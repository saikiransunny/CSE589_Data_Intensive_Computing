politics,"AdvertisementSupported byFrom the release of James Comey’s private memos about his meetings with President Trump to developing talks with North Korea, let us catch you up on six big stories from the week. By Emily CochraneJames B. Comey’s redacted, declassified memos detailing his meetings with President Trump were released late Thursday after the Justice Department sent them to Congress. The release came hours after Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, spoke with Michael Barbaro of The New York Times for an interview on the podcast “The Daily.”The memos offer an intimate look at the interactions between officials at the highest levels of government in the months leading to Mr. Comey’s ouster, elaborating on the president’s concerns about the salacious dossier detailing his supposed ties to Russia and the investigation into Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser at the time. Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at his former F.B.I. director this week as Mr. Comey continued his publicity tour across television networks to promote his tell-all memoir, “A Higher Loyalty.”Andrew G. McCabe, Mr. Comey’s former deputy director who was fired hours before retirement, also faced renewed attacks from conservatives after federal prosecutors began examining whether they had enough evidence to open a criminal investigation. A Justice Department inspector general report had repeatedly faulted Mr. McCabe for misleading investigators.Additional Reading and ListeningRead the memos here. Congressional Memo: Pressure to Release Comey Memos May Have Backfired on G.O.P.6 Takeaways from the James Comey MemosMr. Trump confirmed that Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and his nominee for secretary of state, visited North Korea to meet with its leader, Kim Jong-un. The goal of the trip, which took place over Easter weekend, was to lay the groundwork for a summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. But Mr. Trump warned on Wednesday that if he felt the diplomatic gesture was not headed toward success, he would scrap the planned summit meeting or even walk out while it was underway. Although the North has reportedly dropped its demand that the United States remove troops from South Korea as a condition for denuclearization, the Trump administration has reacted warily. But the president reacted more favorably early Friday evening when Mr. Kim announced that North Korea no longer needed to test nuclear weapons or missiles and would close a nuclear test site. “This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.The president, who spent part of the week meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, also rebuffed the prospect of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade agreement. It was another blow to Japan, which fears it has been sidelined as Mr. Trump cultivates relationships with other Asian countries. Additional ReadingSanctions Are Hurting North Korea.

He succeeded, however, in limiting the strikes to three targets that did not risk endangering Russian troops at military installations scattered through Syria. But a military intelligence report found that while the strikes probably stalled the production of sarin gas, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is expected to continue researching and developing chemical weapons. There was also a public divide over whether the administration would impose a fresh round of sanctions against Russian companies found to be aiding Syria’s chemical weapons program. Mr. Trump rejected the measure after his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, said on a Sunday television program that the administration would be enforcing them. Ms. Haley pushed back against the idea that there had been “momentary confusion” over the issue, as Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser had suggested. “With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” she said.

Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, will join Mr. Trump’s legal team in an attempt to “quickly” resolve the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and ties to Trump campaign associates. A federal judge in Manhattan indicated on Monday that she was not prepared to grant Mr. Trump exclusive first access to the documents that F.B.I. agents had seized in raids on the office and hotel room of his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. In the courtroom, it was also revealed that Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator, was another client of Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen has been treated poorly by Mr. Trump over the course of their relationship, with gratuitous insults, dismissive statements and, at least twice, threats of being fired. There is now concern about that treatment backfiring if Mr. Cohen ends up cooperating with federal officials. Mr. Trump’s campaign also faced a new legal entanglement on Friday after the Democratic National Committee named the campaign in a sweeping lawsuit filed in federal court. The committee says it was the victim of a conspiracy by Russian officials, the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

However, he is also expected to receive a historic rebuke from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is not likely to recommend his confirmation. The C.I.A. is mounting an unusual campaign to ensure that its deputy director, Gina Haspel, a career spy with a highly classified career, succeeds Mr. Pompeo as the agency’s director. Ms. Haspel faces opposition from Democrats, who are likely to have questions about her role in overseeing the brutal interrogation of a terrorism suspect at a secret prison in Thailand and conveying orders to destroy videos that documented torture.The nominee to lead NASA, Jim Bridenstine, was confirmed on Thursday in a stark partisan vote, ending the longest span of time that the agency has gone without a leader. The vote, which lasted more than 45 minutes, was punctuated by the arrival of Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois. She cast her “no” vote with her infant daughter cuddled in her lap — a first for the Senate. Additional ReadingG.O.P.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.By reneging on the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has said, he will be able to get an even better deal, one that would also control Iran’s ballistic missiles and its regional influence.Sound familiar? It should. This is the same kind of gesture toward a better, smarter deal that Mr. Trump made when he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, the same sort of empty promise he made in saying he would supply plans for Middle East peace and better, cheaper, more accessible health care. So far, again and again, he has shown himself to be adept at destroying agreements — a relatively easy task for a president — and utterly lacking in the policy depth or strategic vision and patience to create new ones.When it comes to the danger of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, there is no sign Iran or any of the other major powers in the existing and so far successful pact will simply fall into line with Mr. Trump’s notional new plan. More likely, his decision, announced on Tuesday, will allow Iran to resume a robust nuclear program, sour relations with close European allies, erode America’s credibility, lay conditions for a possible wider war in the Middle East and make it harder to reach a sound agreement with North Korea on its nuclear weapons program.In other words, par for the course. This man who, apparently because of one book and a reality television show, has a reputation as a deal maker despite a skein of bankruptcies and lawsuits, has been piling up quite a record of scuttled agreements that he suggests “never, ever should have been made” and broken promises for a “better deal.”Consider the Paris agreement, approved by President Barack Obama in 2016. Mr. Trump labeled it a “con job” that is unfair to the United States, and in June he declared his intention to withdraw from it. Mr. Trump suggested he was open to renegotiating this voluntary agreement but has done nothing about it. Meanwhile his administration is chipping away at environmental protections through deregulation even as the nearly 200 countries who signed the deal remain committed to it.Or take DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also established by Mr. Obama. It provides temporary work permits and reprieves from deportation for about 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. Mr. Trump ended it but said he was open to fixing it. But he hasn’t, ordering instead a crackdown by federal immigration agents that has torn countless families apart and left millions of other undocumented people in limbo.Similarly, the southern border wall, the centerpiece of his presidential campaign that was supposed to be paid for by Mexico, is more mirage than reality — and whatever parts are being built are being paid for by America.He promised a better deal on health care, with cheaper costs and universal coverage. He never proposed one. Instead, after Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he attacked it administratively, increasing the number of people without insurance and raising premiums.One of his first moves in office was to withdraw from the United States-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he had called “a rape of our country.” Last month he raised the possibility of rejoining it but then stepped back again.Then there is Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the United States, Mexico and Canada have been unable to agree on amending, after months of negotiations.As for China, which Mr. Trump promised to browbeat into offering trade concessions, recent negotiations ended with few signs of progress toward avoiding a trade war.The one agreement on which he forced new negotiations and seems to have scored modest success is the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Even so, the president has suggested he might delay finalizing the pact because it gives him a card to play, presumably with Seoul, while negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear program.Mr. Trump often seems to be consumed with overturning the legacies of his predecessor, but few of the agreements so stoked his disdain as the Iran nuclear deal, Mr. Obama’s signature diplomatic achievement. Signed in 2015 by five major powers as well as the United States and Iran, it committed Iran to significantly curtailing its nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions.International inspectors along with American and Israeli intelligence and security officials have repeatedly judged that Iran is abiding by its obligations. That doesn’t matter to Mr. Trump, allied with the anti-Iran hard-liners in his administration, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Saudi Arabia, who all seem to believe their problems with Iran can best be solved by driving out the regime through economic crisis or military action.Ahead of his decision on Tuesday to impose the “highest level of economic sanctions” on foreign countries doing business in Iran, Mr. Trump put the onus on France, Germany and Britain to address what he considered “flaws” in the accord. For months the Europeans argued this could be done in a side agreement, while keeping the nuclear deal intact, but the effort ultimately collapsed because of Mr. Trump’s insistence on reopening the accord itself. It’s doubtful that Mr. Trump was ever serious about finding a compromise. The Europeans and Iranians, who say they will continue adhering to the deal, hope to manage the fallout, but despite his assurance that he is “ready, willing and able” to negotiate a new agreement, Mr. Trump has no obvious plan B, except ratcheting up the pressure on Iran.It seems an oddly dissonant and counterproductive message as Mr. Trump has shifted from warmongering to diplomacy on North Korea and prepares to meet its leader, Kim Jong-un, to get him to abandon his nuclear program, with an arsenal of 20 to 60 weapons.And why should the North Koreans now believe the Americans, over the long haul, will honor a deal any president strikes?While the stakes with Iran are high, with North Korea they are even higher. Will that be another deal too far for Mr. Trump?OpinionNicholas KristofOpinionRoger CohenAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.We may never stop arguing about which historic currents swept President Trump into the White House.Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum, is unlikely to have had Trump in mind when he described the fourth industrial revolution in Davos in January 2016:We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued,the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.First Schwab looked at the bright side:The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many “workers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,” he said, and the “middle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.”We tend to think of immigration — now fracturing parties of the left and right both here and in Europe — as distinct from technological innovation, but the two issues are intertwined on many levels, even down to the fact that most unauthorized immigrants are people who fly here and overstay their visas, not those who cross rural borders on foot. And air travel is the least of it.In an August 2015 Times story, “A 21st-Century Migrant’s Essentials: Food, Shelter, Smartphone,” Matthew Brunwasser described the situation that obtains now:In this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends.Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, “Patterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century”:The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier.There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative.“The IT revolution improved living standards and its great technical achievements enjoy a high level of consumer and political support,” Mordecai Kurz, an economist at Stanford, wrote in a June 2017 paper. “However these sources of social benefits are also the cause of social losses and rising inequality that threaten the foundation of democratic society.”Schwab, a year earlier, had put it this way: There is an “inexorable shift from simple digitization (the Third Industrial Revolution) to innovation based on combinations of technologies (the Fourth Industrial Revolution).”With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences:As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor.Just to give a sense of the exponential nature of the rate of technological change, here’s how Sergey Brin described it in this year’s “Founders’ Letter,” which was released earlier this week:The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations — a factor of about 200,000 difference — and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.In point of fact, the use of robots — and of other methods of replacing workers with machines — has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe.According to the International Federation of Robotics, “By regions, the average robot density per 10,000 employees in Europe is 99 units, in the Americas 84 and in Asia 63 units.”In a March 2018 paper, “We Were The Robots: Automation in Manufacturing and Voting Behavior in Western Europe,” Massimo Anelli, Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig, of Bocconi University in Milan, found that “robot shock increases support for nationalist and radical right parties.”The authors note that “both technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.”“Job losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email:In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs.Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University — Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen — was crucial to Trump’s victory.In their October 2017 paper, “Political Machinery: Did Robots Swing the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election?” the authors demonstrate thatSupport for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper:AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (‘mid-skilled’) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services.In his paper, “Computers and Populism: Artificial Intelligence, Jobs and Politics in the Near Term,” Levy writes:On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization’s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs.Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, “there should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities” by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects.Surveying the trucking industry recently in “The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation,” Darrell West, a scholar at Brookings, warns that full adoption of driverless vehicles “would put at least 2.5 million drivers out of work.”Assessing the full range of employment, West observes thatRobots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs.Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace,the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case.Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy’s answer is: farther down the ladder:AI’s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage workinto such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services.For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women’s and reproductive rights movements.)Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers:Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill.Levy writes:A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the ""people” and the “elite” based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal “elites” who make a very good living developing robots to put “the people” out of work.While Levy looks at the issue from the vantage point of those harmed by A.I., robotics and information technology, Kurz, the Stanford economist, examines the economic winners. In a recent essay for Project Syndicate, he writes:IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial.The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks thedark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth.While operating legally — indeed with the full support of the legal system — contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz:Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors — additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs — then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms.According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences:Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion — equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income — in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points.The result is a cascading effect causedboth by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular.Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, pointed out in a December 2017 paper, “Should We Be Reassured If Automation in the Future Looks Like Automation in the Past?” thatThe history of automation — and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades — suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation.Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs:The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience.Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in “the process of turnover,” which “could lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.” In the short run,not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this “short run” could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of “short runs” for even longer.A short run that lasts for decades — or a series of short runs that last even longer — would seem to warrant grave alarm.While much of the focus on job losses resulting from robotization and trade has been on men, a January 2018 study led by Saadia Zahidi, head of Education, Gender and Work, at the World Economic Forum, found that “among the workers affected by labor market disruptions, under both models, a larger share — 57 percent — are projected to be female.”A separate study of the potential consequences of automation in England, “Managing automation: Employment, inequality and ethics in the digital age,” written by Carys Roberts, Mathew Lawrence and Loren King, researchers at the Institute for Public Policy Research, found thatOf all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology.Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade.Furman lists some initiatives:expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice.Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income.These proposals — some underwhelming or undoable — find strong support among Democratic elected officials.Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant — not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans.Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect.Expanding on Autor’s work, Andrea Cerrato and Francesco Ruggieri, of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and Federico Maria Ferrara, of the University of Geneva, wrote in their March 2018 paper, “Why Does Import Competition Favor Republicans? Localized Trade Shocks, Voting Behavior, and Scapegoating in the U.S.”:Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups.The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants “takes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.”In other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well.In highly polarized times, when partisans view victory by the opposition as a threat to the nation, Republicans will easily find ways to rationalize continued economic deterioration and the ongoing demonization of immigrants and minorities. They’ve had a lot of practice and they have effectively boxed themselves into a scapegoat strategy that capitalizes on — instead of improving — the suffering of many of their most loyal supporters.The hard core of Trump’s voters — more than half of all Republican voters don’t just approve of him, but strongly approve — have, in turn, demonstrated a willingness to deify the president no matter what he does or says — a deification dependent in no small part on Trump’s adoption of new communications technologies like Twitter.The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval — and the success of this strategy to date — suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics — if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBy James B. StewartWith President Trump ordering steep new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum on Thursday, and with America’s trading partners threatening to retaliate, it looks as if Mr. Trump will get the trade war that he seems to want and that he thinks will be “easy” for the United States to win.“Trade wars aren’t so bad,” he had said at the White House on Wednesday.Which made me wonder: What trade wars does Mr. Trump have in mind?The most prominent trade war of the 20th century was ignited by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act of 1930, which imposed steep tariffs on roughly 20,000 imported goods. Led by Canada, America’s trading partners retaliated with tariffs on United States exports, which plunged 61 percent from 1929 to 1933. The tariffs were repealed in 1934.Historians and economists continue to debate the extent of the damage to the global economy, but there is little disagreement that Smoot-Hawley and the ensuing trade war exacerbated and prolonged the hardships of the Great Depression. Many historians contend it also contributed to the rise of the Nazis and other fascist parties. There is almost universal agreement that no one “won” that trade war.Smoot-Hawley “was such a disaster that it’s held sway over American trade policy for over 80 years,” said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who also teaches international trade law at Johns Hopkins University. “No one wants to repeat it.”He called Mr. Trump’s comments on trade wars “a dramatic departure” from economic orthodoxy.On the question of who wins, “the easy answer is to say that no one wins a trade war,” said Marc-William Palen, a professor of history at the University of Exeter in Britain and the author of “The ‘Conspiracy’ of Free Trade,” which examines trade rivalry between the United States and the British Empire in the 19th century. “But the more I reflect on it, it seems the winners are those nations that don’t take part.”Professor Palen cited the late-19th-century trade wars between Canada and the United States, which caused a precipitous drop in Canadian exports to America and led Canada to seek export markets in Britain. “The British Empire was the winner,” he said.Another “big winner” from a trade war it was not involved in, Professor Palen said, was Soviet Russia, which was largely shunned by Western trading partners after the 1917 revolution and the rise of communism, and was desperate for hard currency. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Professor Palen said, caused countries like Italy to abandon American imports and resume trading with the Soviets, forging trade links that persist today.A textbook case of one country’s “winning” a trade war occurred during the late 19th century when a newly unified Italy imposed steep tariffs on imports from France in order to spur domestic industrialization. France, which was much richer and stronger, retaliated with tariffs against Italy, and Italian exports to France collapsed. Even after Italy abandoned its tariffs, France continued to punish Italy for years with high tariffs.“France won in the sense that the trade war was brutal for the Italians,” said John Conybeare, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Iowa, and the author of the book “Trade Wars.”Professor Conybeare said an enduring lesson from that trade conflict was that if there is a wide disparity in economic strength between two countries, the stronger country will probably prevail. “Trump must be thinking that the large size of the U.S. domestic market gives it a lot of bargaining power in any trade dispute,” he said.While that may be true with much smaller, weaker countries, it is not the case with trading partners of equal or even larger size, such as the European Union and China. “Without that large disparity in economic strength, both sides lose,” Professor Conybeare said.He cited what have become known as the “chicken wars” of the early 1960s, a trade dispute set off when Germany and France imposed tariffs on American chicken. The United States retaliated by imposing tariffs on an array of goods, including French brandy, light trucks and Volkswagen buses. The United States even threatened to reduce its troop presence in Europe. Despite those pressures, the newly formed European Economic Community did not back down, and in that sense the United States “lost” the war.The biggest losers, though, were American and European consumers deprived of choices in the marketplace and forced to pay higher prices for what was available.There were also unintended consequences. American automakers, insulated from foreign competition by the tariffs, failed to modernize, improve quality or reduce costs, setting the stage for a decades-long decline, which for Chrysler and General Motors ended in bankruptcy.Much the same can be said of the United States steel industry, which since World War II has probably received more protection from tariffs and quotas than any other industry. “They just used the protection to raise prices, fatten profits, pay their executives more and avoid automating and reducing costs,” Professor Conybeare said. “They didn’t use the breathing space they gained to modernize. So much of the U.S. steel industry is using obsolete technology, which is why they can’t compete.”Decades of tariff protection have done little to stem the industry’s decline. Domestic steel employment dropped from 135,000 in 2000 to 83,600 in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Much like Mr. Trump, President George W. Bush veered from Republican free trade orthodoxy in 2002 when he imposed tariffs of up to 30 percent on certain steel products to counter what he claimed was a surge of imports (Canada, Mexico and a number of developing countries were exempted). Although the tariffs were loudly condemned by many Republicans, politicians from steel-producing states supported the move and protectionist Democrats like Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri argued that the measures did not go far enough.The European Union filed charges with the World Trade Organization, which ruled that the tariffs were illegal and discriminatory and authorized up to $2 billion in retaliatory measures. The E.U. threatened tariffs on a variety of American products, including autos and Florida oranges.Mr. Bush abandoned the tariffs in December 2003. He claimed that they had served their purpose, but subsequent studies suggested that they had little impact on employment in the industry and led to a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in industries that use steel as a raw material.Mr. Trump’s pronouncements on trade this week “sound like a very archaic, 19th-century argument,” Professor Palen said, referring to a time when protectionism was Republican orthodoxy and Representative William McKinley of Ohio, who later became president, was successfully promoting his Tariff Act of 1890, which raised the average duty on imports to nearly 50 percent.The act is widely considered by historians to have been a disaster that led to higher consumer prices and inflation and provoked a voter backlash. Republicans lost their House majority in 1890 and lost the White House and both houses of Congress in 1892. The act was repealed in 1894.In any trade war, as that example suggests, “the big losers are consumers, who are the vast majority of people,” Professor Palen said. “A few industries may benefit, but there are way more losers than winners. And the poor are the biggest losers of all. People like Trump may not care that much about paying a few extra dollars. But a lot of people don’t have that luxury.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Adam B. SchiffRepresentative Adam B. Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, is the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.In 2010, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, I led the effort to impeach a federal judge from New Orleans named Thomas Porteous Jr. He was accused of multiple acts of corruption, some of which preceded his appointment to the federal bench, and making false statements during his confirmation hearing. After a lengthy impeachment process in the House, the Senate convicted him on all four charges and removed him from office.Impeachment and removal for federal officials is an extraordinarily rare event. Judge Porteous was only the eighth federal official impeached and convicted in our nation’s history. As we investigated and drafted his articles of impeachment, we faced the consequential decision of whether to charge Judge Porteous with conduct before he took office.We had to go back nearly a century to the 1912 trial and conviction of Judge Robert Archibald to find a precedent. After much consideration, we decided to charge him not only for actions while he was on the federal bench, but also for a corrupt scheme he entered into with a bail bond company while a state court judge, and for the false statements he made during his Senate confirmation process.We determined that because Judge Porteous was accused of taking cash and gifts from lawyers whose cases he presided over in state court, there was little question that such actions were incompatible with his responsibility as a federal judge. How could someone in his courtroom be confident of a fair trial, knowing he had solicited and accepted bribes while a judge?In voting overwhelmingly to convict Judge Porteous on every count, the Senate established the precedent that a federal official can be removed for conduct committed before assuming office.Because of the Porteous case, it is clear that if President Trump participated in a conspiracy to defraud the United States during the campaign by colluding with the Russians, there is a historical basis for the Senate to remove him from office. It is even more clear that if he committed the offense of obstruction of justice while in office, that would provide a legal basis for removal.Yet, one of the most important lessons I learned during the Porteous case was that the legal standard for what constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor is less important than the practical and political standard that must be met in any impeachment case. And while that political standard cannot be easily or uniformly defined, I think in the present context it means the following: Was the president’s conduct so incompatible with the office he holds that Democratic and Republican members of Congress can make the case to their constituents that they were obligated to remove him?If they cannot, if impeachment is seen by a substantial part of the country as merely an effort to nullify an election by other means, there will be no impeachment, no matter how high the crime or serious the misdemeanor.This is a very high bar, and it should be. Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy, not to be entertained lightly, and in the case of a president, would mean putting the country through a deeply wrenching process. It is instead a remedy that must be considered soberly, mindful of the fact that removing a president from office should be the recourse for only the most serious transgressions.Should the facts warrant impeachment, that case will be made more difficult politically if part of the country feels that removing Mr. Trump is the result that some of their fellow Americans were wishing for all along.During the course of our investigation in the House Intelligence Committee, we have found troubling evidence of both collusion and obstruction of justice. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, has no doubt seen even more than we have, but his investigation is not complete, and our efforts continue as well. There is much more work to do before any of us can say whether the evidence rises to the level that we should consider a remedy beyond the one that voters will render at the ballot box.Given the evidence that is already public, I can well understand why the president fears impeachment and seeks to use the false claim that Democrats are more interested in impeachment than governing to rally his base. Democrats should not take the bait. Let President Trump arouse his voters as he will, while Democrats continue to focus on the economy, family and a return to basic decency. And in the meantime, all Americans should reserve judgment until the investigations have run their course.Adam B.

Flatiron Books. $29.99.In his absorbing new book, “A Higher Loyalty,” the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey calls the Trump presidency a “forest fire” that is doing serious damage to the country’s norms and traditions.“This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values,” Comey writes. “His leadership is transactional, ego driven and about personal loyalty.”Decades before he led the F.B.I.’s investigation into whether members of Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, Comey was a career prosecutor who helped dismantle the Gambino crime family; and he doesn’t hesitate in these pages to draw a direct analogy between the Mafia bosses he helped pack off to prison years ago and the current occupant of the Oval Office.A February 2017 meeting in the White House with Trump and then chief of staff Reince Priebus left Comey recalling his days as a federal prosecutor facing off against the Mob: “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.” An earlier visit to Trump Tower in January made Comey think about the New York Mafia social clubs he knew as a Manhattan prosecutor in the 1980s and 1990s — “The Ravenite. The Palma Boys. Café Giardino.”The central themes that Comey returns to throughout this impassioned book are the toxic consequences of lying; and the corrosive effects of choosing loyalty to an individual over truth and the rule of law. Dishonesty, he writes, was central “to the entire enterprise of organized crime on both sides of the Atlantic,” and so, too, were bullying, peer pressure and groupthink — repellent traits shared by Trump and company, he suggests, and now infecting our culture.[ALSO READ: James B. Comey: By the Book]“We are experiencing a dangerous time in our country,” Comey writes, “with a political environment where basic facts are disputed, fundamental truth is questioned, lying is normalized and unethical behavior is ignored, excused or rewarded.”“A Higher Loyalty” is the first big memoir by a key player in the alarming melodrama that is the Trump administration. Comey, who was abruptly fired by President Trump on May 9, 2017, has worked in three administrations, and his book underscores just how outside presidential norms Trump’s behavior has been — how ignorant he is about his basic duties as president, and how willfully he has flouted the checks and balances that safeguard our democracy, including the essential independence of the judiciary and law enforcement. Comey’s book fleshes out the testimony he gave before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June 2017 with considerable emotional detail, and it showcases its author’s gift for narrative — a skill he clearly honed during his days as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.The volume offers little in the way of hard news revelations about investigations by the F.B.I. or the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III (not unexpectedly, given that such investigations are ongoing and involve classified material), and it lacks the rigorous legal analysis that made Jack Goldsmith’s 2007 book “The Terror Presidency” so incisive about larger dynamics within the Bush administration.What “A Higher Loyalty” does give readers are some near-cinematic accounts of what Comey was thinking when, as he’s previously said, Trump demanded loyalty from him during a one-on-one dinner at the White House; when Trump pressured him to let go of the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn; and when the president asked what Comey could do to “lift the cloud” of the Russia investigation.There are some methodical explanations in these pages of the reasoning behind the momentous decisions Comey made regarding Hillary Clinton’s emails during the 2016 campaign — explanations that attest to his nonpartisan and well-intentioned efforts to protect the independence of the F.B.I., but that will leave at least some readers still questioning the judgment calls he made, including the different approaches he took in handling the bureau’s investigation into Clinton (which was made public) and its investigation into the Trump campaign (which was handled with traditional F.B.I. secrecy).“A Higher Loyalty” also provides sharp sketches of key players in three presidential administrations. Comey draws a scathing portrait of Vice President Dick Cheney’s legal adviser David S. Addington, who spearheaded the arguments of many hard-liners in the George W. Bush White House; Comey describes their point of view: “The war on terrorism justified stretching, if not breaking, the written law.” He depicts Bush national security adviser and later Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as uninterested in having a detailed policy discussion of interrogation policy and the question of torture. He takes Barack Obama’s attorney general Loretta Lynch to task for asking him to refer to the Clinton email case as a “matter,” not an “investigation.” (Comey tartly notes that “the F.B.I. didn’t do ‘matters.’”) And he compares Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to Alberto R. Gonzales, who served in the same position under Bush, writing that both were “overwhelmed and overmatched by the job,” but “Sessions lacked the kindness Gonzales radiated.”Comey is what Saul Bellow called a “first-class noticer.” He notices, for instance, “the soft white pouches under” Trump’s “expressionless blue eyes”; coyly observes that the president’s hands are smaller than his own “but did not seem unusually so”; and points out that he never saw Trump laugh — a sign, Comey suspects, of his “deep insecurity, his inability to be vulnerable or to risk himself by appreciating the humor of others, which, on reflection, is really very sad in a leader, and a little scary in a president.”During his Senate testimony last June, Comey was boy-scout polite (“Lordy, I hope there are tapes”) and somewhat elliptical in explaining why he decided to write detailed memos after each of his encounters with Trump (something he did not do with Presidents Obama or Bush), talking gingerly about “the nature of the person I was interacting with.” Here, however, Comey is blunt about what he thinks of the president, comparing Trump’s demand for loyalty over dinner to “Sammy the Bull’s Cosa Nostra induction ceremony — with Trump, in the role of the family boss, asking me if I have what it takes to be a ‘made man.’”Throughout his tenure in the Bush and Obama administrations (he served as deputy attorney general under Bush, and was selected to lead the F.B.I. by Obama in 2013), Comey was known for his fierce, go-it-alone independence, and Trump’s behavior catalyzed his worst fears — that the president symbolically wanted the leaders of the law enforcement and national security agencies to come “forward and kiss the great man’s ring.” Comey was feeling unnerved from the moment he met Trump. In his recent book “Fire and Fury,” Michael Wolff wrote that Trump “invariably thought people found him irresistible,” and felt sure, early on, that “he could woo and flatter the F.B.I. director into positive feeling for him, if not outright submission” (in what the reader takes as yet another instance of the president’s inability to process reality or step beyond his own narcissistic delusions).After he failed to get that submission and the Russia cloud continued to hover, Trump fired Comey; the following day he told Russian officials during a meeting in the Oval Office that firing the F.B.I. director — whom he called “a real nut job” — relieved “great pressure” on him. A week later, the Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.During Comey’s testimony, one senator observed that the often contradictory accounts that the president and former F.B.I. director gave of their one-on-one interactions came down to “Who should we believe?” As a prosecutor, Comey replied, he used to tell juries trying to evaluate a witness that “you can’t cherry-pick” — “You can’t say, ‘I like these things he said, but on this, he’s a dirty, rotten liar.’ You got to take it all together.”Put the two men’s records, their reputations, even their respective books, side by side, and it’s hard to imagine two more polar opposites than Trump and Comey: They are as antipodean as the untethered, sybaritic Al Capone and the square, diligent G-man Eliot Ness in Brian De Palma’s 1987 movie “The Untouchables”; or the vengeful outlaw Frank Miller and Gary Cooper’s stoic, duty-driven marshal Will Kane in Fred Zinnemann’s 1952 classic “High Noon.”One is an avatar of chaos with autocratic instincts and a resentment of the so-called “deep state” who has waged an assault on the institutions that uphold the Constitution.[ALSO READ: Comey’s Memoir Offers Visceral Details on a President ‘Untethered to Truth’]The other is a straight-arrow bureaucrat, an apostle of order and the rule of law, whose reputation as a defender of the Constitution was indelibly shaped by his decision, one night in 2004, to rush to the hospital room of his boss, Attorney General John D. Ashcroft, to prevent Bush White House officials from persuading the ailing Ashcroft to reauthorize an N.S.A. surveillance program that members of the Justice Department believed violated the law.One uses language incoherently on Twitter and in person, emitting a relentless stream of lies, insults, boasts, dog-whistles, divisive appeals to anger and fear, and attacks on institutions, individuals, companies, religions, countries, continents.The other chooses his words carefully to make sure there is “no fuzz” to what he is saying, someone so self-conscious about his reputation as a person of integrity that when he gave his colleague James R. Clapper, then director of national intelligence, a tie decorated with little martini glasses, he made sure to tell him it was a regift from his brother-in-law.One is an impulsive, utterly transactional narcissist who, so far in office, The Washington Post calculated, has made an average of six false or misleading claims a day; a winner-take-all bully with a nihilistic view of the world. “Be paranoid,” he advises in one of his own books. In another: “When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.”The other wrote his college thesis on religion and politics, embracing Reinhold Niebuhr’s argument that “the Christian must enter the political realm in some way” in order to pursue justice, which keeps “the strong from consuming the weak.”Until his cover was blown, Comey shared nature photographs on Twitter using the name “Reinhold Niebuhr,” and both his 1982 thesis and this memoir highlight how much Niebuhr’s work resonated with him. They also attest to how a harrowing experience he had as a high school senior — when he and his brother were held captive, in their parents’ New Jersey home, by an armed gunman — must have left him with a lasting awareness of justice and mortality.Long passages in Comey’s thesis are also devoted to explicating the various sorts of pride that Niebuhr argued could afflict human beings — most notably, moral pride and spiritual pride, which can lead to the sin of self-righteousness. And in “A Higher Loyalty,” Comey provides an inventory of his own flaws, writing that he can be “stubborn, prideful, overconfident and driven by ego.”Those characteristics can sometimes be seen in Comey’s account of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, wherein he seems to have felt a moral imperative to address, in a July 2016 press conference, what he described as her “extremely careless” handling of “very sensitive, highly classified information,” even though he went on to conclude that the bureau recommend no charges be filed against her. His announcement marked a departure from precedent in that it was done without coordination with Department of Justice leadership and offered more detail about the bureau’s evaluation of the case than usual.As for his controversial disclosure on Oct. 28, 2016, 11 days before the election, that the F.B.I. was reviewing more Clinton emails that might be pertinent to its earlier investigation, Comey notes here that he had assumed from media polling that Clinton was going to win. He has repeatedly asked himself, he writes, whether he was influenced by that assumption: “It is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president, my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls. But I don’t know.”He adds that he hopes “very much that what we did — what I did — wasn’t a deciding factor in the election.” In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, Comey stated that the very idea that his decisions might have had an impact on the outcome of the presidential race left him feeling “mildly nauseous” — or, as one of his grammatically minded daughters corrected him, “nauseated.”Trump was reportedly infuriated by Comey’s “nauseous” remark; less than a week later he fired the F.B.I. director — an act regarded by some legal scholars as possible evidence of obstruction of justice, and that quickly led to the appointment of the special counsel Robert Mueller and an even bigger cloud over the White House.It’s ironic that Comey, who wanted to shield the F.B.I. from politics, should have ended up putting the bureau in the midst of the 2016 election firestorm; just as it’s ironic (and oddly fitting) that a civil servant who has prided himself on being apolitical and independent should find himself reviled by both Trump and Clinton, and thrust into the center of another tipping point in history.They are ironies that would have been appreciated by Comey’s hero Niebuhr, who wrote as much about the limits, contingencies and unforeseen consequences of human decision-making as he did about the dangers of moral complacency and about the necessity of entering the political arena to try to make a difference.Michiko Kakutani, former chief book critic for The New York Times, is the author of the forthcoming book “The Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump.” Follow her on Twitter: @michikokakutaniAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

FeimsterDr. Feimster is an associate professor of African-American studies and American studies at Yale.“A Woman Lynched” read a headline in The New York Times on Aug. 20, 1886. A mob had taken “Eliza Woods, colored” from a jail in Jackson, Tenn., and hanged her for supposedly poisoning her employer.The journalist Ida B. Wells protested the lynching in an editorial for The Gate City Press, a black newspaper in Kansas City, Mo. Eliza Woods “was taken from the county jail and stripped naked and hung up in the courthouse yard and her body riddled with bullets and left exposed to view!” Wells later wrote in her diary. “Oh, my God! Can such things be and no justice for it?”At least 130 black women were murdered by lynch mobs from 1880 to 1930. This violence against black women has long been ignored or forgotten. Not anymore. Eliza Woods’s name is now engraved on one of the 800 weathered steel columns hanging from the ceiling of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opened Thursday in Montgomery, Ala.The inclusion of black women who were lynched is an important step in the long struggle to acknowledge the violent history of racial and gender inequality.When most Americans imagine lynching, they envision the tortured and mutilated body of a black man accused of raping a white woman. They rarely think of a black woman “stripped naked and hung.” Wells, however, was well aware that black women were victims of Southern mob violence and also targets of rape by white men.In 1892, when mobs across the South murdered more than 200 African-American men and women, including one of Wells’s closest friends, she began to systematically investigate lynchings. As I’ve noted in my academic work, she soon discovered that few victims had even been accused of rape. In an editorial, she wrote that “nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that Negro men rape white women.” In retaliation, a white mob destroyed her press and warned Wells, who was in New York at the time, not to come back or risk death.Wells was not intimidated. Instead, she crossed the country lecturing on the evils of mob violence. She traveled to Britain, where she started an international crusade against lynching. She initiated one of the first public hearings to address both racial and sexual violence. Wells also sought to protect black women against rape by white men.From the start, she relied on the support of a network of black women. At a fund-raiser at Lyric Hall in New York, Wells described the group as “the greatest demonstration ever attempted by race women for one of their own number.” The proceeds from the event allowed her to publish “Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases,” the first anti-lynching pamphlet.In “Southern Horrors,” Wells made clear that white men perpetrated sexual violence against black women, while black men were brutalized by white mobs for having consensual sex with white women. And by showing that only about 30 percent of the black victims of lynch mobs had actually been accused of rape, Wells challenged the idea that lynchings resulted from it.She argued that the portrayal of black men as rapists put them “beyond the pale of human sympathy.” And she suggested that such a focus concealed the rape of black women. And it gave cover to whites’ violent efforts to rob African-Americans of their rights.Drawing attention to the sexual crimes of white men, she noted that chivalry “can hope for little respect from the civilized world when it confines itself entirely to the women who happen to be white.” Wells uncovered the long history of white men raping black women. “Not one who reads the record as it is written in the faces of the million mulattos in the South,” she wrote, “will for a minute conceive that the Southern white man had a very chivalrous regard for the honor due the women of his own race or respect for the womanhood which circumstance placed in his power.”Wells’s genius lay in her ability to flip the script, casting white Southern men as the lustful rapists of black women and the hypocritical murderers of innocent black men. Alone, she was not able to stop lynching. But with the help of other black women, she did put mob violence on the reform agenda and brought to light the rape of black women.Yet when most Americans remember Wells, they remember her solely as a campaigner against lynching. We hear little of the woman who linked economic exploitation, lynching and sexual violence. Erased is the person who believed that lynching was a way to control white women’s sexuality, especially those who had sexual relationships with black men. Gone is the radical feminist who insisted on women’s rights to sexual justice and equal protection.A history of lynching must remember black women like Eliza Woods. It should recognize that the rape of black women devastated communities. And it ought to highlight how black women organized against rape and lynching. Anything less prevents one of the most radical movements for racial and sexual justice from speaking to the many challenges of our time.The memorial and museum in Montgomery are long overdue. And they represent a call to action that begins with an acknowledgment of hidden truths.Crystal N.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Lisa W. FoderaroThere have been millions of dollars in campaign spending. Churlish television ads. Allegations of ignoring sexual misconduct complaints.From the outset, it has been clear that Tuesday’s special election in New York’s 37th State Senate District is no ordinary contest; the race in Westchester County will help determine the balance of power in Albany.The intense scrutiny for a seemingly obscure seat is the result of a fragile deal that was recently brokered in which a group of breakaway Democrats who had long shared power with Senate Republicans agreed to return to the Democratic fold. That collaboration had helped give Republicans control of the Senate, despite Democrats holding a numerical majority, until early April, when the so-called Independent Democratic Conference agreed to return to the mainstream fold.The deal gave the Democrats a chance to sweep the Legislature and governor’s office. There was just one hitch: two Senate seats that had previously been occupied by Democrats will be decided on Tuesday in special elections.With such high stakes, the Democratic challenger, Shelley B. Mayer, an assemblywoman from Yonkers, is now engaged in a heated clash with Julie Killian, a moderate Republican and former councilwoman and deputy mayor in the City of Rye.That seat became available after its former occupant, George Latimer, a Democrat, won the race last year for Westchester County executive. The district was redrawn in 2012 by Senate Republicans to favor their party.In a county where Democrats outnumber Republicans by two-to-one, the presidency of Donald J. Trump has loomed large in the race. Ms. Mayer’s campaign is running ads in which Ms. Killian is made to look like a Trump clone. In an interview, Ms. Killian declined to address Mr. Trump’s record or rhetoric, saying she had been too focused on her race to follow the news out of Washington.“The perspective I want to bring to Albany is that of a mother, chemical engineer, finance person and community advocate involved in substance abuse and mental health issues,” she said. “It’s my on-the-ground experience that has shaped my views on the issues.”A mother of five, Ms. Killian, 57, studied engineering in college and, after earning a master’s in business, worked in finance. In 2012, she created a coalition to fight the opioid epidemic, which claimed the lives of several young people in Rye in recent years alone.At a time of national reckoning for women who were victims of sexual abuse, Ms. Killian’s campaign has sought to show that Ms. Mayer dropped the ball in addressing sexual misconduct complaints when, before running for the Assembly, she served as legal counsel to the Senate Democrats.According to a recent report in The Daily News, two women — one a former Senate staff member, the other still employed — said that in 2010, Ms. Mayer failed to help them when they alerted her to sexual harassment they had suffered at the hands of their bosses.In recent debates, Ms. Mayer, 64, acknowledged that she met with one of the women, and learned about the other incident through the woman’s boyfriend. She followed the protocol in place at the time, which was to refer allegations to the secretary of the Senate, a political appointee.“In both cases, I went to the secretary of the Senate and I made the case that they need to do more,” she said in a debate held in the studios of WRNN-TV on Tuesday. “They failed to do so. ”In an interview, Ms. Mayer said that the Assembly has a rule that requires mandatory reporting of any allegation of sexual misconduct to an outside law firm. “I believe the policy in the Senate was very flawed then, and the Senate Republicans just adopted it again,” she said.Ms. Killian has nonetheless seized on the report in an effort to cast doubt on Ms. Mayer’s feminist credentials. “She’s no champion of women,” Ms. Killian said. “She had the opportunity to help them. She was the most senior woman in the Senate Democrats at the time.”Some newly minted activists are not buying the portrayal. “There are two females in this race, but only one is pro-woman,” said Jenny Geer, who leads a progressive group called Blue Blast in Larchmont and Mamaroneck and who has canvassed for Ms. Mayer. “I think it’s convenient for Julie Killian to piggyback on the #MeToo movement and exploit it.”For her part, Ms. Mayer, who has championed legislation on gun safety, voting rights and redressing sexual abuse, expressed skepticism of Ms. Killian’s self-proclaimed centrist politics, saying she was trying to appeal to the county’s leftward tilt in the age of Trump. “I think she has become a moderate now,” she said. “She has not disavowed this president or anything he has done.”As evidence, Ms. Mayer pointed to one of Ms. Killian’s fund-raisers, Denise Ward, who in a Twitter post attacked a student activist from the high school in Florida that was the scene of the mass shooting in February. Ms. Ward called the student, David Hogg, “idiotic,” a “tool” and a “drone.” Ms. Killian rejected the comments and pledged to return the campaign money.Local Republican officials have embraced Ms. Killian’s candidacy, saying she had the knowledge and energy to capture a seat she had sought once before. In 2016, Ms. Killian lost to Mr. Latimer by more than 10,000 votes in the district, which covers about a third of Westchester, extending from Yonkers to the affluent town of Bedford.“It’s crucial for us in Westchester,” said Douglas A. Colety, chairman of the Westchester County Republican Committee, “and it’s crucial for control of the State Senate in Albany.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

Cuomo in sharp and personal terms on Tuesday, questioning his standing as a “real Democrat,” accusing him of being beholden to corporate donors and linking him and his “cronies” to Albany corruption.It was red-hot rhetoric in only the first 24 hours of an already volatile campaign, complete with an attack — followed by an apology — by a close ally of Mr. Cuomo’s that Ms. Nixon was an “unqualified lesbian.”In Ms. Nixon’s first speech, delivered before a small, mostly African-American crowd in Brownsville, Brooklyn, she outlined the themes of her insurgent bid to knock off Mr. Cuomo, a two-term incumbent, in the Democratic primary: tackling the “very segregated” school system, fixing the subways and addressing the “crushing inequality” in the state.One of the crucial early questions surrounding Ms. Nixon is whether Democratic voters have any interest in elevating a celebrity while Donald Trump is serving as president, let alone doing so at the expense of Mr. Cuomo, whose liberal accomplishments as governor include legalizing same-sex marriage, increasing the minimum wage and establishing paid-family leave.“It’s time for an outsider,” Ms. Nixon told reporters of her qualifications. “I’m not an Albany insider.”Appropriating an attack line from her friend Mayor Bill de Blasio and the former presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders, Ms. Nixon cast New York as divided between the haves and have-nots.“New York State itself is the single most unequal state in the country,” she said.“This is not something that just happens by mistake. It comes from a choice. It comes from a choice to slash taxes for corporations and the super rich and slash services on everybody else,” she said from a podium. “And it’s a choice we’re used to being made by Republicans like Donald Trump. But for the past eight years, it is a choice that’s been made by our governor, Andrew Cuomo.”Only 4 in 10 voters know anything about Ms. Nixon, according to a Siena College poll released this week. That same survey showed Mr. Cuomo leading her among registered Democrats by nearly 40 percentage points, including among every subgroup including women, liberals and minorities.Mr. Cuomo has cast Ms. Nixon, best known for her role on “Sex and the City,” as a B-list celebrity — “I’m hoping that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Billy Joel don’t get into the race,” he said dismissively earlier this month — but he and his allies have reacted swiftly to her entry.On Tuesday, Christine Quinn, the former New York City Council speaker who has been discussed as a possible running mate for Mr. Cuomo, called Ms. Nixon an “unqualified lesbian.” Ms. Nixon backed Mr. de Blasio over Ms. Quinn in the 2013 mayor’s race.“Cynthia Nixon was opposed to having a qualified lesbian become mayor of New York City,” Ms. Quinn told The New York Post, referring to her own candidacy. “Now she wants to be an unqualified lesbian to be the governor of New York. You have to be qualified and have experience.”Ms. Quinn later apologized in an interview. “I was clearly trying to make, perhaps, a tongue-in-cheek comparison that was ill-advised and poorly delivered, and I should never have tried to make,” she said, though she stood by her comments that Ms. Nixon was unqualified.Mr. Cuomo was silent on Tuesday, in Albany with no public schedule ahead of the April 1 state budget deadline.But late on Monday, hours after Ms. Nixon jumped into the race, Mr. Cuomo did make a splash of his own: directing the state attorney general to review the Manhattan district attorney’s handling of a 2015 sexual assault allegation into Harvey Weinstein.Celebrities, including the actress and producer Reese Witherspoon, had called on him to do so hours earlier.Ms. Nixon’s candidacy also got a boost from celebrities; a “Sex and the City” co-star, Kristin Davis, and Rosie O’Donnell quickly endorsed her for governor. But in a sign of Ms. Nixon’s political climb ahead, no prominent elected official attended her event on Tuesday; hours afterward, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York formally endorsed Mr. Cuomo.On her first full day as a candidate, however, Ms. Nixon seemed more than happy to put the focus on Mr. Cuomo.She mocked him for his handling of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways. Ms. Nixon barely made her own launch in time because of train delays.“Cuomo’s M.T.A.,” she said to laughs. “Three trains pulled out of service. We had to get off three trains.”She was just getting warmed up.She hammered Mr. Cuomo for raising only 0.1 percent of his campaign funds from small donors. “If you are a regular person in New York, the chance that Andrew Cuomo is going to care about your concerns is exactly that: 0.1 percent,” she said.She linked him to the Koch brothers, two conservative billionaires who have become liberal boogeymen in recent years. “The Koch brothers donated $87,000 to Andrew Cuomo when he first ran in 2010 because they knew a good investment when they see one,” she said.And she sought to link him to the recent corruption conviction of a former top aide, Joseph Percoco. “There is a reason that people close to Andrew Cuomo keep winding up under indictment for corruption,” she said. (Mr. Cuomo was not accused of any wrongdoing in the Percoco trial and has called his former aide’s behavior a “total aberration.”)Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, a New York Democrat who has endorsed Mr. Cuomo, called Ms. Nixon’s challenge “a wasteful, negative, time-consuming exercise when we should be linking arms and trying to win back the Congress.””I can tell you from my perspective down here in Washington, I don’t even know what this fight is about,” he said. “It just seems like a petty squabble when we’ve got a real fight on our hands.”In her speech, Ms. Nixon touched only briefly on her own biography — born in New York City, attended public schools, the mother of public school attendees — as her wife, Christine Marinoni, looked on from the side of the room.She answered a couple of questions from reporters after her speech, including about her qualifications, as her aides tried to drag her from the scrum of cameras and recorders.“I think it is time, not just in New York State but all over this country, to hear from the voices of real people who understand that our government in New York, and in many places across this country, including federally, is in the clutches of millionaires, billionaires and corporations,” she said.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallHostility to the opposition party and its candidates has now reached a level where loathing motivates voters more than loyalty.The building strength of partisan antipathy — “negative partisanship” — has radically altered politics. Anger has become the primary tool for motivating voters. Ticket splitting is dying out. But perhaps the most important consequence of the current power of political anger is that there has been a marked decline in the accountability of public officials to the electorate.How bad is this problem? In “The Strengthening of Partisan Affect,” Shanto Iyengar and Masha Krupenkin, political scientists at Stanford, note thatWe find that as animosity toward the opposing party has intensified, it has taken on a new role as the prime motivator in partisans’ political lives.Iyengar and Krupenkin argue thatthe impact of feelings toward the out-party on both vote choice and the decision to participate has increased since 2000; today it is out-group animus rather than in-group favoritism that drives political behavior.Along parallel lines, Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster, political scientists at Emory University, argue thatone of the most important trends in American politics over the past several decades has been the rise of negative partisanship in the electorate.In “All Politics is National: The Rise of Negative Partisanship and the Nationalization of U.S. House and Senate Elections in the 21st Century,” Abramowitz and Webster make the case thatTo a greater extent than at any time in the post-World War II era, the outcomes of elections below the presidential level reflect the outcomes of presidential elections. As a result, the famous comment by the late Tip O’Neill that “all politics is local” now seems rather quaint. In the 21st century United States, it increasingly appears that all politics is national.The practice of voting against rather than for has grown steadily since the 2000 election, but it reached new heights in 2016, when both major party nominees were viewed substantially more negatively than positively.On Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election, 58.5 percent of voters had an unfavorable view of Donald Trump and 54.4 percent felt the same way about Hillary Clinton, according to RealClearPolitics. Favorable views were 37.5 for Trump and 41.8 percent for Clinton.Abramowitz and Webster compiled data from the 2012 and 2016 elections to show how much the level of anger among both Democratic and Republican voters increased over four years.In 2012, 33 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans described themselves as angry at the opposing party’s presidential candidate “most of the time” or “just about always.” In 2016, the percentage of Democratic voters who said they were this angry at Trump rose to 73 percent, and the percentage of Republicans with that level of hostility toward Hillary Clinton rose to 66 percent.This trend helps explain seemingly contradictory voter attitudes catalogued in both “All Politics is National” and a second Abramowitz-Webster paper, “Negative Partisanship: Why Americans Dislike Parties but Behave like Rabid Partisans.”From one vantage point, the view of each major party has steadily worsened. As Abramowitz and Webster point out:The percentage of Americans with favorable opinions of both parties is now the lowest it has been since the American National Election Studies began asking this question in 1978.At the same time, “record numbers of voters in 2016 were dissatisfied with their own party’s presidential nominee.” Trump and Clintonwere the most unpopular major party candidates for president since the ANES introduced the feeling thermometer scale in 1968.The “feeling thermometer scale” asks voters to rank candidates and institutions on a scale of 0 to 100, in which 100 is very warm or favorable, zero is very cold or unfavorable and 50 is neutral or no feeling.The accompanying graphic shows that both Democrats and Republicans had favorable views of their own candidates from 1968 to 2012, ranging from 76.5 percent in 1968 to 78.5 percent in 2012. In 2016, however, with Trump and Clinton as the nominees, the thermometer rating dropped sharply to 60.9 percent.Over the same period, “feeling thermometer” ratings of the opposition candidate fell sharply, from 56.2 in 1968 to 25.1 in 2012. In 2016, the ratings of the opposition candidate plummeted to 12.2.Despite the public’s increasingly adverse views of political parties, party loyalty in voting has now reached record levels, according to the two authors. Partisanship currently “has a stronger influence on vote choice than at any time since the 1950s.”How can these conflicting trends be reconciled? Voters dislike the parties and are dissatisfied with their candidates, even as they cast straight-ticket ballots. This may sound inconsistent, but it’s not that hard to understand.According to Abramowitz and Webster, in 2016, “large majorities of Democrats and Republicans truly despised the opposing party’s nominee.” Voters were motivated to go to the polls to cast ballots against the opposition’s nominee much more than to support their own party’s choice. The key factor “in predicting party loyalty in the 2016 presidential election was how voters felt about the opposing party’s presidential candidate.”In fact, Abramowitz and Webster found that “this measure was twice as important in predicting loyalty as feelings toward the candidate from one’s own party.” Partisan loyalty remained “very high because both Democratic and Republican identifiers overwhelmingly viewed the opposing party’s candidate with deep hostility.”In the 1970s, about a quarter of all voters split their tickets, voting for presidential and congressional candidates of different parties. Now, not even one in 10 does so. The result:In 2016, all 34 Senate elections and 400 of 435 U.S. House elections were won by the party winning the presidential election in the state or district.In their analysis of negative partisanship, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue that voting on the basis of hostility has an unexpected consequence: It lessens pressure on the winner to be accountable to his or her supporters, effectively freeing winners to thumb their noses at many of the voters who put them in office:When citizens’ support for a candidate stems primarily from their strong dislike for the opposing candidate, they are less subject to the logic of accountability. Their psychic satisfaction comes more from defeating and humiliating the out-group, and less from any performance or policy benefits that might accrue from the victory of the in-party. For this group of voters, candidates have every incentive to inflame partisan negativity, further entrenching affective polarization.By this logic, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue thatIf partisans care less about their own party’s performance and instead focus on their distrust of the opposition party, elected officials no longer need campaign on their own merits; instead, they have good reason to try even harder to denigrate the opposition.In other words, Trump critics who anticipate a collapse of support when he fails to deliver on campaign promises are likely to be disappointed. According to Iyengar and Krupenkin,The primal sense of “us against them” makes partisans fixate on the goal of defeating and even humiliating the opposition at all costs. This negativity bias in voting behavior undermines traditional theories of electoral accountability that rest on incumbents’ ability to deliver policy and performance benefits.Candidates and incumbents, Iyengar and Krupenkin continue, “are less likely to be sanctioned for demonstrating incompetence, dishonesty and unethical behavior.”To make their point, the authors cite Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama last December, pointing out that under partisan conditions “a candidate accused of molesting teenage children is able to attract 91 percent of the vote from his copartisans.”What explains the extraordinary level of support for Moore, not only from Republican voters but also from the larger population of white Alabamians, at 68 percent, and conservatives, at 83 percent?They can’t all have been happy with their candidate, but a partial answer can be found in a study published last month, “One Tribe to Bind Them All: How Our Social Group Attachments Strengthen Partisanship,” by Lilliana Mason and Julie Wronski, political scientists at the University of Maryland and the University of Mississippi.The authors found that just as the Democratic Party is often described as a collection of identity groups, identity politics have also become a powerful force within the Republican Party. They argue, in fact, that “this effect is more powerful among Republicans than among Democrats, due to the general social homogeneity of the Republican Party,” with the result that “Republicans are more susceptible to identity-based politics.” For Republicans,the general white, Christian conservative alliance with the party led to a far simpler categorization of who is in the group and who is outside of it.Why would this lead to more willingness to vote for someone with as much baggage as Roy Moore? The convergence of voter identification with voters’ social identity — conservative, white, Christian — “makes in-party preference more powerful and out-party tolerance ever more difficult.”Put another way, Republican doubts about Roy Moore were superseded by hatred of the Democratic Party.There is no sign that the growth in negative polarization will slow down, much less reverse itself. The dominant incentive in politics right now is to capitalize on animosity to the opposition party.At a time when true swing voters have become a smaller and smaller share of the electorate, hatred, anger and animosity have proven the most effective tools to mobilize support.By email, I asked Webster and Iyengar the following question: “Does negative partisanship override polarization on issues of race, sex, immigration, feminism, traditional family structure, LGBT issues, military spending and policy, etc.?”Webster replied:I’d be more inclined to say that negative partisanship has helped to perpetuate and exacerbate the degree of partisan polarization that we have in the U.S.Iyengar contended that “affective divergence exceeds policy-related divergence.” A more “ ‘primal’ view of partisanship” has been gaining strength among social scientists, he wrote, noting the discoverythat children acquired a sense of party identification quite early in the life cycle without any “flickering awareness” of party differences on the issues. Moreover, as people moved through the life cycle, with corresponding changes in economic circumstances and interests, their sense of partisanship was unmoved despite considerable change in their stances on the issues.President Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, succinctly described the role of negative partisanship in contemporary American politics during a January interview with Michael Lewis: “Anger and fear is what gets people to the polls.”The data support Bannon. The Pew Research Center found in June 2016 that the demonization — vilification — of political opponents has become entrenched:Today, sizable shares of both Democrats and Republicans say the other party stirs feelings of not just frustration, but fear (56 percent of Democrats, 49 percent of Republicans) and anger (47 percent Democrats, 46 percent Republicans).Not only do almost half of Republicans say Democrats are lazier than other Americans, more dishonest (45 percent), more closed-minded (52 percent) and more immoral (47 percent), most (59 percent) also say the members of their own party are more hard-working.The Pew findings offer little comfort to those seeking concord. Some 70 percent of Democrats “say that Republicans are more closed-minded than other Americans.” Four out of ten Democrats say “Republicans are more dishonest,” and a third say Republicans are immoral and unintelligent.As partisan conflict increasingly resembles guerrilla warfare, as political opponents despise each other as a matter of routine, the tactic of “enemy construction” takes root. A “friend-enemy” dichotomy gains strength. Opponents are demonized, defamed, delegitimated and dehumanized — “justifying the compromise of ordinarily recognized liberties”— in the words of RonNell Andersen Jones and Lisa Grow Sun in “Enemy Construction and the Press.”In “The Existential Need for Enemy” György Csepeli, Zoltán Vági and Richárd Nagyfi write:Each party holds negative, stereotypical images of the other stemming from the need to justify the deeds of hostility. The negative and simplified stereotypes are needed in order to simplify the conflict excluding discoveries of similarities between the groups in conflict. The individuals in intergroup conflict systematically tend to misperceive each other to accentuate differences. The resulting images tend to perpetuate negative stereotypes of each other containing oversimplified, inaccurate and derogatory beliefs concerning the other group that are identified as the enemies.Just as adversaries are denigrated, allies are praised:The image of self, in contrast, reflects glorification of everyone who is alike. A mirror image emerges in which each party sees the other one negatively and itself positively. On the basis of the overgeneralized difference stemming from the categorization into in-group and out-group, the group members in each group necessarily will be pushed into the labyrinth of cognitive biases which are the cornerstones of the hostile image of the other.As politics become a form of mortal combat, a strange burden falls on those who are most engaged. In the words of the conservative German jurist and political theorist Carl Schmitt — who as a supporter of the Third Reich knew something about hatred — the combatants must, as he wrote in “The Theory of the Partisan,”consider the other side as entirely criminal and inhuman, as totally worthless. Otherwise they are themselves criminal and inhuman. The logic of value and its obverse, worthlessness, unfolds its annihilating consequence, compelling ever new, ever deeper discriminations, criminalizations, and devaluations to the point of annihilating all of unworthy life.It is not too much to say that a significant number of voters in both of America’s major political parties see their adversaries as worthless. And history teaches us that the logic of worthlessness has chilling implications.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Judy BermanWith every new episode of “Saturday Night Live,” you can find us here writing about the most notable sketches. See you next Saturday, April 14, for an episode hosted by John Mulaney with musical guest Jack White. President Trump had his sights set abroad this week, announcing plans to send National Guard troops to the United States border with Mexico and hurtling toward what many fear will become a trade war with China. But on Saturday evening, he faced an unexpected crisis much closer to home: In Midtown Manhattan, the president’s flagship edifice, Trump Tower, briefly caught fire.Just hours later, Alec Baldwin took the stage less than half a mile away to reprise his recurring role as Trump in the opening sketch of a “Saturday Night Live” episode hosted by the “Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman and featuring the musical guest Cardi B.After issuing a “Fox News Alert” made up solely of the word “Mexicans,” Harris Faulkner (Leslie Jones), a co-host of the network’s female-dominated talk show “Outnumbered,” segued into a joint news conference between the president and the leaders of the Baltic nations.“Let’s make this quick because I’ve got a lot of trade wars to escalate here, O.K.?” said Baldwin’s impatient President Trump, by way of a greeting. “That’s why I just announced tariffs on more Chinese products, including fireworks and finger traps.”He hastened to introduce his counterparts from Estonia, Lithuania and, Baldwin said, “I wanna say Stankonia.” (The third Baltic nation is actually Latvia. “Stankonia” is the title of an album by the hip-hop duo OutKast.)[ Want to know what’s new on your streaming services? Lucky for you, we’ve done all the hard work and picked the best titles to watch. ]When Baldwin was compelled to take questions from reporters, he deflected a query about the president’s claim that he was unaware of the payout that the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels received in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement about their relationship.“Borat, you wanna take that one?” he asked Alex Moffat, playing President Raimonds Vejonis of Latvia.“We have an expression in my country,” Moffat said. “And it translates roughly as, ‘This man is lying.’”The final query of the cold open came from a reporter played by Melissa Villaseñor, who wondered if the president was worried that the new trade tariffs would imperil the United States’ standing in the world.“I’m the only one who’s willing to actually say this: I don’t care about America, O.K.?” Baldwin replied. “This whole presidency is a four-year cash grab, and admitting that will probably get me four more years.”In other memorable moments from this episode:This week brought the return of the beloved “S.N.L.” sketch “Black Jeopardy,” which stars Kenan Thompson as the game show’s host, Darnell Hayes.“This might be the blackest ‘Black Jeopardy’ yet,” he announced.Categories included “Fid’na,” “Aw Hell Naw” and “White People,” among others. The contestants were Leslie Jones as Shanice, Chris Redd as Rashad — and Boseman as his “Black Panther” character, T’Challa, the king of a fictional, quasi-utopian, all-black African nation called Wakanda.As you might imagine, T’Challa experienced a bit of culture shock. He bungled questions about credit card debt and parenting, before buzzing in on a clue about law enforcement: “The policeman says there’s been some robberies in your neighborhood and asks if you have any information.”Boseman responded, “What is, not only do I tell this man what I know, but I also assist him in tracking down the offender. After all, our ministers of law enforcement are only here to protect us.”Thompson twisted his features into an expression reminiscent of the nauseated face emoji.“I’m thinking you haven’t spent much time in America,” he said.The “Weekend Update” co-anchor Colin Jost also addressed President Trump’s decision to send National Guard troops to the border with Mexico, even though, he pointed out, “reports show that illegal border crossings are at their lowest level since 1971.”He continued, “It’s all part of Trump’s philosophy: ‘If it ain’t broke, I’ll break it.’”A robotic Mark Zuckerberg, played by Moffat, stopped by “Weekend Update” to address the criticism he has received since the Cambridge Analytica data leak.“Hi there, Colin,” he greeted Jost, before instructing himself to “begin eye contact.”“Unlike my facial expression, Facebook is going to change,” Moffat promised, in an interview punctuated by high-pitched giggles and stiff attempts at dabbing.He concluded with a disingenuous mea culpa:“My point is, sure, maybe Facebook sold out our democracy to Russian troll farms. My bad? But, on the other hand: Farmville. To be honest, I feel great about Facebook’s future. I sleep easy at night, upside down in my pressurized sleep egg. And sure, I still have all your photos, your memories, your unspoken thoughts and fears. But, America, look at me in my shark eyes when I say this — that, on behalf of everyone on Facebook, I’m sorry. On opposite day!”What started out as a sketch about three girlfriends at Disneyland found its punch line in the R&B singer R. Kelly, who has been the subject for many years of disturbing accusations.Staring into a “magic” mirror that had shown her friends their “personal Disney princesses,” Jones was surprised to find the leather-clad musician staring back at her, then gyrating with a bag of popcorn held over his crotch.“What are you up to R. Kelly? Why is R. Kelly in there?” she demanded. “The last place he needs to be is Disneyland!”The rapper Cardi B, who released her debut album, “Invasion of Privacy,” on Friday, played a medley of her biggest hits to date, “Bodak Yellow” and “Bartier Cardi,” in her first performance of the night.Clad in white and black fur, sporting close-cropped green hair, and flanked by four backup dancers, she delivered a typically energetic (and heavily bleeped) performance.She showed off her softer side in a performance of a quieter “Invasion of Privacy” track, “Be Careful,” appearing in a long, high-necked dress with a retro beehive hairdo. When the camera pulled back from a close-up to show her torso, the form-fitting dress seemed to reveal that Cardi B was pregnant.Shortly after the performance, her fiancé, the rapper and Migos member Offset, appeared to confirm that impression on Instagram.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy David LeonhardtOpinion ColumnistThis article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.Another day, another dizzying array of Trump news.The president glibly tweeted about bombing Syria. He talked about reversing a centerpiece of his own trade policy. The contents of the James Comey book began to emerge, with new details about the “pee tape.” And news broke that the National Enquirer apparently killed a story about President Trump fathering a child with his housekeeper.Given all of this craziness, today seems a good day to tell a story that I’ve been wanting to share with you for awhile:For a recent column, I did some retrospective reporting on last year’s Alabama Senate campaign. During that race, the progressive group Priorities USA came up with a series of political messages and then ran online surveys to see which advertisements resonated with voters. The goal was to see which were most and least likely to motivate African-Americans to turn out and vote for Doug Jones, the Democrat running against Roy Moore.Priorities USA had a long list of potential themes to choose from: Moore’s history as an accused molester; his ties to white supremacists; his opposition to Obamacare; Doug Jones’s endorsements from civil-rights leaders; and more.The most effective message, as I described in the column, ended up being one about education — how Jones would help more people go to college and get good jobs. I didn’t have room in the column to describe what the least effective message was: One that cast Moore as a rubber stamp for President Trump.People who heard this message actually seemed to become less likely to vote. As Civis Analytics, a data firm hired by Priorities, wrote in a memo, “This finding is consistent with previous research on African-American voters, which suggests that many feel less motivated to be politically involved when Trump’s name is invoked.”I was surprised by the result. I figured that anger about Trump would inspire all sorts of progressive voters to become more politically engaged. But Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorites, had a good explanation.To many African-American voters in Alabama, Cecil said, “Donald Trump is the living embodiment of the idea that voting doesn’t matter.” Trump is profoundly unfit to be a president — a congenital liar and racist who lost the popular vote by 2.9 million votes. And yet president he is.The midterm election will be the most consequential political event in the country this year, as The New Yorker’s David Remnick has suggested. It’s a chance for Americans to reject Trumpism and to hold Trump accountable for his actions. But making that happen won’t necessarily involve focusing on the man himself all of the time.“I don’t think making tired partisan arguments or saying one more mean thing about Donald Trump is going to do it,” as Cecil says.I’m not suggesting that the country ignore the day-to-day news about Trump. I’m merely suggesting that we all keep it in perspective.More Comey. Michiko Kakutani returns to the pages of The Times, with a review of Comey’s book. She writes that Comey’s themes include “the toxic consequences of lying; and the corrosive effects of choosing loyalty to an individual over truth and the rule of law.”Reader critique: Paul Ryan. I received a thoughtful piece of criticism in response to yesterday’s newsletter, which praised Paul Ryan for, if nothing else, being honest about his desire to cut Medicare and Social Security. The email comes from a reader who’s been involved in health care policy and focuses on Obamacare, also known as the A.C.A. Here’s an excerpt:“I agree that Paul Ryan has been more open than most Republicans to saying he wants to change Social Security and Medicare, but he has not shown the same candor about the ACA. One of the Republicans’ main electoral and governing points for the past 8 years has been that they could keep almost everyone insured while having lower costs and fewer rules than the ACA — a position for which there has never been credible evidence ….“I think he’s knowledgeable enough to know this. And since the ACA has been a live policy issue, which Social Security and Medicare have not been, this failure of candor is much more important than his very partial candor on the other. So, even within entitlement issues alone, I think he’s pretty hypocritical.”Programming note.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.In 1994, Newt Gingrich, brandishing his Contract with America, led a Republican revolution that swept aside Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate, initiating an epoch of conservative ascendancy that lingers on. Don Sipple, a Republican campaign consultant, declared at the time that the 1994 midterms pitted a Republican Party calling for “discipline” against a Democratic Party focused on “therapy.”Two years later, George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley, published “Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think,” which argued thatDeeply embedded in conservative and liberal politics are two different models of the family. Conservatism is based on a Strict Father model, while liberalism is centered on a Nurturant Parent model. These two models of the family give rise to different moral systems.Several approaches to contemporary politics echo the insights of Sipple and Lakoff. The crucial word now, however, is authoritarianism.The election of Donald Trump — built as it was on several long-term trends that converged in 2016 — has created an authoritarian moment. This somewhat surprising development is the subject of “Remaking Partisan Politics through Authoritarian Sorting,” a forthcoming book by the political scientists Christopher Federico, Stanley Feldman and Christopher Weber, who argue thatThree trends — polarization, media change, and the rise of what many people see as threats to the traditional social order — have contributed to a growing divide within American politics. It is a divide between those who place heavy value on social order and cohesion relative to those who value personal autonomy and independence.The three authors use a long-established authoritarian scale — based on four survey questions about which childhood traits parents would like to see in their offspring — that asks voters to choose between independence or respect for their elders; curiosity or good manners; self-reliance or obedience; and being considerate or well-behaved. Those respondents who choose respect for elders, good manners, obedience and being well-behaved are rated more authoritarian.The authors found that in 1992, 62 percent of white voters who ranked highest on the authoritarian scale supported George H.W. Bush. In 2016, 86 percent of the most authoritarian white voters backed Trump, an increase of 24 percentage points.Federico, Feldman and Weber conclude thatAuthoritarianism is now more deeply bound up with partisan identities. It has become part and parcel of Republican identity among non-Hispanic white Americans.Last year, Federico, writing with Christopher Johnston of Duke and Howard G. Lavine of the University of Minnesota, published “Open versus Closed: Personality, Identity, and the Politics of Redistribution,” which also explores the concept of authoritarian voting.In an email, Johnston summarized some of their findings:Over the last few decades, party allegiances have become increasingly tied to a core dimension of personality we call “openness.” Citizens high in openness value independence, self-direction, and novelty, while those low in openness value social cohesion, certainty, and security. Individual differences in openness seem to underpin many social and cultural disputes, including debates over the value of racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity, law and order, and traditional values and social norms.Johnston notes that personality traits like closed mindedness, along with aversion to change and discomfort with diversity, are linked to authoritarianism:As these social and cultural conflicts have become a bigger part of our political debates, citizens have sorted into different parties based on personality, with citizens high in openness much more likely to be liberals and Democrats than those low in openness. This psychological sorting process does not line up perfectly with older partisan differences based on class, because those higher in income and education also tend to be higher in openness.Johnston addresses class differences in voting patterns and also differences stemming from the level of a voter’s interest in politics:An important caveat is that individuals who take a stronger interest in politics and know more about it are more likely to be sorted on the basis of openness. So, it’s really among those most “politically engaged” Democrats and Republicans where we see members of different parties diverge in openness. Moreover, sorting into different parties on the basis of openness appears to be much stronger among non-Hispanic whites than other racial and ethnic groups.In their book, Johnston, Lavine and Federico reinforce this point:With the rise of cultural and lifestyle politics, Democrats and Republicans are now sharply distinguished by a set of psychological dispositions related to experiential openness — a general dimension of personality tapping tolerance for threat and uncertainty in one’s environment.The revived interest in authoritarianism in politics began well before anyone seriously considered the possibility of a Trump candidacy — except, apparently, Trump himself.In 2009, Marc J. Hetherington of Vanderbilt and Jonathan D. Weiler of the University of North Carolina, wrote one of the fundamental texts on this topic, “Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics.”In it, Hetherington and Weiler argue thatpreferences about many of the new issues on the American political agenda, such as gay rights, the war in Iraq, the proper response to terrorism, and immigration are likely structured by authoritarianism.There are “colliding conceptions of right and wrong,” they write, between those on the high and low ends of the authoritarian scale. That, in turn, makes it difficult “for one side of the political debate to understand (perhaps, in the extreme, even respect) how the other side thinks and feels.”This October, Hetherington and Weiler will publish an elaboration on their argument, “Prius or Pickup? How the Answers to Four Simple Questions Explain America’s Great Divide.” They are abandoning the use of the word authoritarian because of its negative connotations and its association with fascism.In an email to me, Hetherington said that in their book he and Weiler will describe “people on opposite sides of the divide as having a fixed or fluid worldview:”Those with a fixed worldview tend to see “American Carnage,” while those with fluid worldviews see the world as a big, beautiful place that is safe to explore. The fixed tend to be wary of what they perceive as constant threats to their physical security specifically and of social change in general. The fluid are much more open to change and, indeed, see it as a strength. For them, anger lies in holding on to old ideas and rejecting diversity.Hetherington and Weiler argue that the answers to questions about the four childhood traits reveal “how worldview guides a person in navigating the world,” as Hetherington put it in his email:Not only do the answers to these questions explain preferences about race, immigration, sexual orientation, gender attitudes, the projection of military force, gun control, and just about every “culture war” issue, people’s worldviews also undergird people’s life choices. Because ‘the fixed’ are wary about the dangers around them, they prefer the country over the city. ‘The fluid’ prefer the reverse.Political analysts have become more and more aware of how voters’ sense of themselves as liberals or conservatives, Democrats or Republicans, has taken on heightened importance. Affirming one’s political tribe or community has in many respects become more important in deciding whom to vote for than the stands candidates take on issues.In a March paper, “Ideologues Without Issues,” Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, wrote:The power behind the labels “liberal” and “conservative” to predict strong preferences for the ideological in-group is based largely in the social identification with those groups, not in the organization of attitudes associated with the labels. That is, even when we are discussing ideology — a presumably issue-based concept — we are not entirely discussing issues.Mason continued:Identity-based ideology can drive affective ideological polarization even when individuals are naïve about policy. The passion and prejudice with which we approach politics is driven not only by what we think, but also powerfully by who we think we are.Matt Grossmann and Daniel Thaler of Michigan State University further expand on the role of psychological traits in voter decision-making in their forthcoming paper, “Mass-Elite Divides in Aversion to Social Change and Support for Donald Trump.” They found that aversion to change “is strongly predictive of support for Trump” among regular voters, but much less so among Republican political elites.They measure aversion to change by the answers to two polling questions: “Our country is changing too fast, undermining traditional American values” and “By accepting diverse cultures and lifestyles, our country is steadily improving.”The accompanying graphic shows how those who think that the country is changing too fast and who disagree with the notion that diverse cultures and lifestyles improve the United States voted decisively for Trump.Leonie Huddy, a political scientist at Stony Brook, sent me her analysis of how political conflict has shifted from economic to psychological factors.The groups that have come to define partisanship in recent years, she wrote,are far more grounded in social and moral values, geographic choice, and identity politics than the influential groups of yesteryear (especially unions) that maintained a focus on group economic interests. African-Americans may be an exception, but there is even a trend among young blacks to move away from the Democratic Party because they see the party as insufficiently focused on police brutality and other issues.The result, in her words, is a political environment in whichthe new affinities that shape partisanship are more a matter of choice than something one is born into or passed on by parents. That gives partisanship a more fluid nature than in the past and opens it to the formation of affinities grounded in personality, values, religion, and lifestyle choices.In her 2005 book, “The Authoritarian Dynamic,” Karen Stenner — a former member of the political science departments at Princeton and Duke and now a behavioral economist in Australia — described politics as a clash of conflicting personal beliefs or moral value systems.Stenner demonstrated, first, that levels of authoritarianism rise and fall in proportion to the experience of “normative threat,” and second that over the past generation authoritarianism has been predictive of Republican voting.Stenner developed auniversal theory about what causes intolerance of difference in general, which includes racism, political intolerance (e.g. restriction of free speech), moral intolerance (e.g. homophobia, supporting censorship, opposing abortion) and punitiveness. It demonstrates that all these seemingly disparate attitudes are principally caused by just two factors: individuals’ innate psychological predispositions to intolerance (“authoritarianism”) interacting with changing conditions of societal threat.Looked at this way, recent developments experienced by many voters as alarming — including the financial collapse of 2008, the surge of third-world immigration in the United States and Europe and continuing fears among traditionalists that the social order is under assault — have fueled authoritarianism:The threatening conditions, resonant particularly in the present political climate, that exacerbate authoritarian attitudes include at least the perception of civil dissent and unrest, loss of confidence in social institutions, unpopularity of leaders on both sides of politics, divisive presidential campaigns, internal or external crises that undermine national pride or confidence, national economic downturn and rapidly rising crime rates.In an email, Stenner provided figures from a recent EuroPulse survey showing that authoritarianism is stronger in the United States than it is in the European Union: In the E.U., 33 percent of the electorate can be described as authoritarian, while in the United States, it’s 45 percent.The animosity between authoritarians and non-authoritarians has helped establish what Johnston, Lavine and Federico describe as the “expressive dimension” of policy choices:In this view, the influence of personality on economic opinion arises not because the expected outcomes of a policy match an individual’s traits, but because those traits resonate with the social meaning a policy has acquired.They explain further:Citizens care less about the outcomes a policy produces and more about the groups and symbols with which a policy is associated.Mason enlarged on this argument in her 2015 paper, “‘I Disrespectfully Agree’: The Differential Effects of Partisan Sorting on Behavioral and Issue Polarization.” Her argument is a direct challenge to those who take, as she puts it,an instrumental view of politics, in which people choose a party and decide how strongly to support it based solely on each party’s stated positions and whether the party shares interests with them.Instead, she writes,Contrary to an issue-focused view of political decision making and behavior, the results presented here suggest that political thought, behavior, and emotion are powerfully driven by political identities. The strength of a person’s identification with his or her party affects how biased, active, and angry that person is, even if that person’s issue positions are moderate.While much of this research uses the “preferred traits in child-rearing” questions to measure authoritarianism, two sociologists at the University of Kansas, David Norman Smith and Eric Hanley, observe in “The Anger Games: Who Voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 Election, and Why?” that those questions do not capture the full scope of authoritarianism, especially the more aggressive authoritarianism that they believe drives voters to Trump.Smith and Hanley used what they call a “domineering leader scale” to measurethe wish for a strong leader who will force others to submit. The premise is that evil is afoot; that money, the media and government authority — and even “politically correct” moral authority — have been usurped by undeserving interlopers. The desire for a domineering leader is the desire to see this evil crushed.The domineering leader scale is based on responses to two statements: “Our country will be great if we honor the ways of our forefathers, do what the authorities tell us to do, and get rid of the ‘rotten apples’ who are ruining everything” and “What our country really needs is a strong, determined leader who will crush evil and take us back to our true path.”If an aggressive, domineering authoritarianism is a prime motivator for many Trump supporters, as Smith and Hanley contend, the clash between Republicans and Democrats is likely to become more hostile and warlike.Federico, Feldman and Weber note thatsince the early 2000s, many especially acrimonious political debates have focused on threats to social stability and order — debates surrounding abortion, transgender rights, immigration, and the role of the federal government in protecting the rights of marginalized social groups.The rising “salience of these debates,” they write, “has contributed to a growing ‘authoritarian divide’ within the United States, at least among White Americans.”Trump has purposefully exacerbated the “many especially acrimonious political debates” now dominating public discourse, deepening not only the authoritarian divide, but the divide between open and closed mindedness, between acceptance and racial resentment, and between toleration of and aversion to change. He evidently believes that this is the best political strategy for presiding in the White House and winning re-election, but it is an extraordinarily destructive strategy for governing the country and for safeguarding America’s interests in the world.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallOver the next six months, Democratic voters will be asked again and again whether their party’s candidates should hew to the center or move to the left.How voters answer that question will help shape the strategic plans of the dozen or more Democrats jockeying to beat President Trump in 2020.The intraparty tension has been simmering for months. Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, goaded party centrists last May when he declared abortion a Democratic litmus test:“Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman’s right to make her own choices about her body and her health,” Perez said in a statement. “That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state.” Perez later backed off.But in July, Ben Ray Luján, a congressman from New Mexico who is the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, declared that not only would the D.C.C.C. support anti-abortion Democrats, he was already working closely with the Blue Dog caucus — the party’s 18-member conservative House faction, which includes several members who oppose abortion rights — to recruit candidates for 2018.“There is not a litmus test for Democratic candidates,” Luján told The Hill. “You need to make sure you have candidates that fit the district, that can win in these districts across America.”“The Democratic Party cannot give an inch in their opposition to this Administration,” Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, countered. That is “especially true when it comes to abortion rights. The Democratic Party cannot and will not win if it turns its back on women and our fundamental rights.”“The days of the Blue Dogs are over,” Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, declared in an interview with Bloomberg News.The center-versus-left theme dominated the nasty primary fight for the Democratic nomination in the Illinois Third District on Tuesday. The incumbent, Dan Lipinski, a conservative abortion opponent, edged out his liberal challenger, Marie Newman, 51.2-48.8 — a contest in which several of Lipinski’s own colleagues rooted for his defeat.Social and cultural issues played a huge role in the campaign. “This was a district where some of us as individuals decided to get involved,” Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Politico. “I would like my husband and I to be considered equal by colleagues in our caucus.”No matter who won, the district was expected to stay in Democratic hands in the general election.The more significant election in the Democrats’ strategic debate was the widely publicized special election victory last week of Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat, in a mostly white, working-to-middle class western Pennsylvania congressional district.Lamb’s success in flipping a hard-core Republican electorate placed the choice facing Democrats running for president and those running for House and Senate in swing districts and states front and center: Does the path to victory lie in mobilizing the liberal base — by taking explicitly left-wing stands on immigration, as well as gun rights, universal health care, the minimum wage, racial justice and so on?Or is the widespread hatred of Donald Trump — at least among Democrats — sufficient to turn out progressive and minority voters, which would make undecideds the constituency that must be more actively wooed?Lamb pointedly strayed from Democratic orthodoxy on the Second Amendment, minimum wage and Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs. His willingness to break with his party on those issues was crucial to his victory. As a decorated veteran, Lamb muted Democratic liabilities on military issues.By winning a district that Trump had carried by 20 percentage points, Lamb set off a national debate.“These results should terrify Republicans,” Luján, the D.C.C.C. chair, declared. “There are more than 100 districts more favorable for Democrats than this one, and we look forward to competing hard in every single one.”“Democrats Can Run the Conor Lamb Strategy Over and Over” read the headline of an article by Jonathan Chait in New York magazine:There are a lot of Conor Lambs out there. Very early in the election cycle, Democrats recruited candidates with nontraditional backgrounds, especially in the military, who would appeal to voters in red districts.No way, Bob Moser argued in a Rolling Stone essay, “Why Democrats Should Worry About Conor Lamb’s Victory.”“The real message of Lamb’s campaign basically boiled down to this: ‘Look at what a fine young normal white fellow I am!’ ” Moser wrote. The “clamor for centrism,” according to Moser, risksdeflating the Resistance, turning off nonwhite voters, and dampening the turnout that Democrats should be able to expect in November, given the level of Trump animus across the country.This intraparty struggle will not be resolved on the merits. It will be hammered out by strategists and candidates over the next two and a half years and will ultimately be decided by Democratic primary voters. The evidence suggests that the balance of power among these voters is shifting to the left.Since 1976, there has been a steady reduction in the number of conservative voters participating in Democratic primaries, according to Seth J. Hill and Chris Tausanovitch, political scientists at U.C.L.A. and U.C.S.D. in their paper “Southern realignment, party sorting, and the polarization of American primary electorates, 1958 — 2012.”In 1976, conservative Democrats were a significant force within the party, making up 27 percent of its supporters. By 1992, their share fell to 24 percent, still a factor to be reckoned with, providing a crucial source of support to Bill Clinton.By 2012 — the last year for which the authors have data — conservative Democrats had been marginalized in primaries, reduced to 7 percent.Over the latter third of the 20th century, Hill and Tausanovitch write,conservatives sorted into the Republican primary, liberals sorted into the Democratic primary, and centrists began turning out at somewhat lower rates in primary elections.These trends are illustrated in the accompanying graphics for 1976, 1992 and 2012. Each chart breaks the electorate into deciles: the first decile, on the left, is the most liberal; the tenth, on the right, the most conservative.I asked Tausanovitch what the implications were for moderate Democrats looking at 2018 and 2020:Clearly the Democratic primary electorate is more extreme in recent elections than in 1992. This appears to be the result of party sorting: liberals are more likely to be Democrats, and conservatives are more likely to be Republicans than in the past.Asked whether a centrist Democrat like Bill Clinton — who came out for the death penalty, welfare reform, “rights and responsibilities” and who publicly rebuffed the rapper and activist Sister Souljah — could win the nomination today, Tausanovitch replied:If primary voters choose the candidate that most closely reflects their views, then there isn’t much hope for a more moderate Democrat.There are a substantial number of Democrats, especially among party officials, activists and consultants, who believe that candidates, especially at the presidential level, need to stake out centrist positions and avoid the perception of being in lock step with liberal interest groups.In a March 17 article in The Hill, Dan Glickman, a former congressman from Kansas, asked “what was the message” Conor Lamb’s victory sent to Democrats? His answer:It means that being a calm, thoughtful and polite moderate is a winning strategy once more.Glickman and his centrist allies are, however, likely to be drowned out by the vociferous opposition to this idea.Not only has the ideological composition of the Democratic electorate shifted leftward, but with Trump in the White House, the liberal wing of the Democratic Party has become energized in a way that has driven a national grass-roots mobilization.Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt, provided insight into the Democratic strategic dilemma in a recent paper, “Partisanship in the Trump Era.”Bartels determined that Democrats are close to united in their support of an activist government that reduces the gap between rich and poor, regulates the environment and insures access to health care.Still, according to Bartels, cultural issues sow discord among Democrats. While more than a quarter of Democratic voters, 26.3 percent, are “closer to the Republicans than to their fellow Democrats” on cultural attitudes, nearly three quarters of Democrats, 73.9 percent, are more liberal on cultural issues.In an email, Bartels described these culturally liberal Democrats as:relatively more enthusiastic about atheists, gays and lesbians, and Muslims; more negative about Fox News, Walmart, and Christians; more willing to rely on “experts”; less likely to say that “anyone who is willing to work hard can still achieve the American dream”; more likely to deny that “the interests of ethnic and racial minority groups often conflict with those of the white majority”; less “authoritarian” (as measured by questions about child-rearing), further to the left in their ideological self-placements, and more pro-choice on abortion.According to Bartels, Democrats who are most firmly culturally liberal are overwhelmingly white.I exchanged emails with a Democratic consultant who has played a prominent role in presidential, Senate and House elections. He asked to remain anonymous in order to be more candid.The first question I posed was: Could Lamb — who did not face a primary — have won the seat if the contest had been held in 2016, during a general election? The answer was no:We know that PA-18 was not winnable in a year with Hillary at the top of the ticket. Democrats did not win any seat with the demographic profile of this one anywhere in the country in 2016 — save for handful of longtime incumbents.How about 2020? Could a centrist like Bill Clinton get the nomination?I’d say the answer is “no.” I think the politics of the Democratic Party have changed significantly since that time and while it may not be the MOST liberal candidate who wins the nomination, all viable candidates will have to pass a certain threshold of liberal-ness.One of the best case studies of center-left intraparty schism can be seen in the upcoming May 22 runoff election for the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District in Texas — upscale suburban Houston.The two candidates are Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a local lawyer who led the primary with 29.3 percent and is generally viewed as the moderate, establishment candidate (referred to as Republican-lite by her opponents), and Laura Moser, a liberal political activist, author and former journalist, who came in second with 24.3 percent, and was described by the Houston Chronicle as the candidate of “those who want a full-fledged push to the left to provide the starkest possible contrast with Trump.”The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, convinced that Moser would be a weak general election candidate, turned the primary contest into an internecine clash when it released a document on Feb. 22 designed to damage Moser’s bid:She is a Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress. In fact, she wrote in Washingtonian magazine, “I’d rather have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia” than live in Texas. As of January 2018, she claimed Washington, D.C. to be her primary residence in order to get a tax break.The attack by the D.C.C.C., viewed by many in the liberal wing of the party as aggressively centrist, generated a backlash, mobilizing the left in support of Moser. She now has endorsements from Howard Dean’s group, Democracy for America, Bernie Sanders’ Our Revolution and the insurgent Justice Democrats.“The D.C.C.C.’s ridiculous attacks on Laura Moser are why Democrats nationally have lost over 1,100 seats. Laura is a rising progressive advocate that the workaday people of Texas desperately need,” Jim Hightower, a board member of Our Revolution, said. “She is an active organizer who takes on the Powers That Be on behalf of the Powers That Ought To Be — workers, consumers, small businesses, and just plain folks.”The district has been in Republican hands for 52 years, since George H.W. Bush first won the seat in 1966. In the 2016 election, however, Hillary Clinton beat Trump there, 49-47, abruptly putting the 10-term Republican incumbent, John Culberson, high on the Democrats’ target list.Whoever wins the runoff, the general election will provide a test of Democratic competitive strength in what could be called Hillary districts — Republican-held seats where she did well. These districts are relatively affluent — in the case of the 7th District, the median household income is $71,183, substantially above the national median of $57,617 and the Texas median, $54,727; and well-educated — 50.7 percent with a college degree or higher, compared to 30.3 percent nationwide and 28.1 percent in all Texas.To bring this full circle, the upscale 7th District in Texas and the downscale 18th District in Pennsylvania effectively represent the dilemma of a party increasingly dominated by cultural liberals.In Texas, that may not prove a liability. Both Moser and Fletcher are on the left on predominantly cultural issues like immigration, gun rights and gay rights. Those positions are clearly becoming more acceptable among affluent, college-educated voters, a constituency in which Democrats have been making steady gains.It is in less well-to-do places like Conor Lamb’s Pennsylvania 18 — where 32.9 percent have a college degree or higher and the median household income of $58,600. Among Lamb’s constituents, cultural liberalism is, consequently, a liability — even fatal, electorally speaking.Democrats can be expected to continue to make gains in upscale districts, especially those that voted for Clinton. But in this election cycle — largely because of the Trump presidency — Democrats have a shot, for the first time in over a decade, at taking back a substantial number of the white working class districts that turned Republican in recent elections. As party leaders have been quick to point out, 118 Republican incumbents represent districts in which Trump’s margin of victory was smaller than it was for Conor Lamb.To nominate candidates who, like Lamb, are equipped to win working and middle class swing districts in the general election will require Democratic primary voters to cast strategic rather than ideological ballots — focusing on who can prevail in November, in 2018 but also in 2020. And, perhaps more to the point, Democratic donors will have to decide whether they can back candidates who agree with them 80 percent but not 99 percent of the time.At a moment when Trump has exacerbated polarization, persuading leaders and voters on the left flank of the Democratic Party to think tactically about the 2020 presidential primaries is crucial but problematic. Insofar as Democrats place a higher priority on purity than viability, they may be risking an indeterminate extension of the Trump era.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Sam RobertsIn 1964, John H. Buchanan Jr., a Southern Baptist minister and Goldwater Republican, was elected to Congress as part of the Deep South’s backlash to the civil rights agenda of the Johnson administration. He was one of the first five Republicans, all elected that year, to be sent by Alabama to the House of Representatives in the 20th century.When he got to Washington, he supported the Vietnam War and school prayer. He voted against Medicare and the Voting Rights Act.But by the late 1960s, the climate in the nation’s capital was changing faster than that in his hometown, Birmingham, where resistance to desegregation was not only respectable but legal. After Mr. Buchanan joined the integrated Riverside Baptist Church in Washington, his perspective began to broaden.“When you’re deeply involved in a biracial entity, you think of people as brothers and sisters,” he told The Washington Post in 1976. “Then the denial of rights of my brothers and sisters becomes an infringement of my rights as well.”In Congress, he helped lead an investigation into the Ku Klux Klan. He supported statehood for the predominantly black District of Columbia and equal rights for women.But by 1980, Mr. Buchanan had left his constituents so far behind that he lost the Republican primary. He was denied renomination for a ninth term in Congress by a former John Birch Society member whose evangelical supporters had been galvanized by the rise of the Rev. Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority.Mr. Buchanan never returned to Alabama to live. He morphed politically into a spokesman for the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way — the Moral Majority’s antithesis — which the television producer Norman Lear founded in 1981.Mr. Buchanan was chairman of the organization’s board from 1982 to 1990. He later formally became a Democrat.He died on March 5 in Rockville, Md., at 89. His daughter Lynn Buchanan said the cause was complications of dementia.John Hall Buchanan Jr. was born on March 19, 1928, in Paris, Tenn., about 100 miles west of Nashville. He grew up in Arkansas and then in Birmingham, where in 1937 his father became the minister of the Southside Baptist Church. His mother was the former Ruth Lowrey.He served in the Navy in 1945 and 1946 as a hospital corpsman, graduated from Howard College (now Samford University) in Alabama in 1949 and earned a master of divinity degree from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.His wife, the former Elizabeth Moore, died in 2011 at 77. In addition to his daughter Lynn, he is survived by another daughter, Elizabeth Buchanan, and three granddaughters.After serving as a pastor in Tennessee, Virginia and Alabama, Mr. Buchanan ran for Congress in 1962. He lost. He was the finance director for the state’s newly stoked state Republican Party and, in 1964, ran again and beat the five-term Democratic incumbent, George Huddleston Jr., a segregationist and states’ rights advocate — and one of his congregants — by a whopping 21-point margin.In the 1964 presidential race, Sen. Barry Goldwater carried the state against President Lyndon B. Johnson. He was the first Republican to do so since Reconstruction.In his first term, Mr. Buchanan joined Representative Charles L. Weltner, a Georgia Democrat, and three other members of Congress on a special panel of the House Committee on Un-American Activities that produced contempt citations against seven Ku Klux Klan officials. The investigation was credited with crippling the Klan in Georgia, Mississippi and elsewhere.It was the first time since the committee was created in the late 1930s that it had expanded its purview of subversion beyond Communism and, occasionally, fascism.Mr. Buchanan began racially integrating his congressional staff. He was the first member of the Alabama congressional delegation to nominate black candidates to the military service academies. He championed the cause of oppressed black majorities in Rhodesia and South Africa.And he strayed from conservative Republican ranks, first to support Title IX of the 1972 Education Act, which required that colleges and universities give women equal opportunities in educational and sports programs, and then to favor extending the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. He lobbied for gender equality in the Foreign Service.Still, Mr. Goldwater loyally campaigned for Mr. Buchanan into the late 1970s as a “fine progressive Republican.”Mr. Buchanan was also a vocal defender of Christians and Jews who were being persecuted in the Soviet Union and its satellites.In 1980, the conservative tide that swept Ronald Reagan to the presidency and Adm. Jeremiah Denton Jr. to the Senate from Alabama finally swept away Republican centrists like Mr. Buchanan. He lost the nomination by 10 points to Albert Lee Smith Jr., a standard-bearer of the religious right.“To contend that there is only one ‘Christian’ position on complex political issues,” Mr. Buchanan said, “is a violation of both the Christian and the democratic traditions.”Lynn Buchanan recalled that when her father was a young man, “to be a Republican was to be progressive, but over the years he really did not relate to what we think of as Republicans now.”After the 1980 race, George Seaborne, Mr. Buchanan’s campaign manager, told The New York Times that to evangelical congregants a preacher’s words are considered gospel.“If the preacher says John Buchanan has an immoral record,” Mr. Seaborne said, “not many are going to get hold of a copy of the Congressional Record to see what the vote was.”Mr. Buchanan later recalled engaging evangelical constituents in a discussion of biblical imperatives during that campaign. He reminded them that Jesus had challenged his own followers to care for the poor.“God has laid that burden on me,” Mr. Buchanan said.“They seemed to respond warmly at the time,” he was quoted as saying. “Then they went back home and beat my brains out.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMore than any president in living memory, Donald Trump has conducted a dogged, remorseless assault on the press. He portrays the news media not only as a dedicated adversary of his administration but of the entire body politic. These attacks have forced the media where it does not want to be, at the center of the political debate.Trump’s purpose is clear. He seeks to weaken an institution that serves to constrain the abusive exercise of executive authority. He has initiated a gladiatorial contest pitting the principle of freedom of the press against a principle of his own invention: freedom from the press.Trump has his media favorites, Fox News and other organizations that serve as approved public relations outlets, versus the “fake news,” meaning virtually everything else.Politicians have frequently questioned the neutrality and objectivity of specific journalists, their stories and their publications, but Trump has raised the stakes to a new level. He has described news organizations as “the enemy of the American people.” He has routinely called reporters “scum,” “slime,” “dishonest” and “disgusting.”In November, Trump proposed a contest to determine which network — Fox excluded — “is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!”The news media “have been incorporated into the political style of the governing party as fixed hate objects,” Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at N.Y.U., wrote in an email to me.Rosen observed that the history of right-wing attacks on the mediaextends back through Agnew’s speeches for Nixon to Goldwater’s campaign in 1964 and winds forward through William Rusher, talk radio, and of course Fox News, which founded a business model on liberal bias.There is an underlying strategy to Trump’s critique of the media. Rosen continued:Trump is not just attacking the press but the conditions that make it possible for news reports to serve as any kind of check on power. Trump is the apotheosis of this history and its accelerant. He has advanced the proposition dramatically. From undue influence (Agnew’s claim) to something closer to treason (enemy of the people.) Instead of criticizing ‘the media’ for unfair treatment, he whips up hatred for it. Some of his most demagogic performances have been exactly that. Nixon seethed about the press in private. Trump seethes in public, a very different act.Trump has some built-in advantages in his war on the media. Confidence in the media was in decline long before Trump entered politics — a slide that reflected the rise in political polarization. Gallup reported in September 2017 that 37 percent of the public had a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence in the mass media, down from 53 percent in 1997. And Trump’s critique of the media reaches a highly receptive audience.An April 2017 Gallup survey found that by a margin of more than 2 to 1, the public said that the press favored one party over the other. Of those who said the media is partisan, 64 percent said that the media favors Democrats, and 22 percent said Republicans.The media, on the other hand, enters the fray with significant disadvantages.In a 2017 paper, “Enemy Construction and the Press,” RonNell Andersen Jones and Lisa Grow Sun, law professors at the University of Utah and Brigham Young University, argue that Trump’s goal is fundamentally malign:The Trump administration, with a rhetoric that began during the campaign and burgeoned in the earliest days of Donald Trump’s presidency, has engaged in enemy construction of the press, and the risks that accompany that categorization are grave.Insofar as Trump succeeds in “undercutting the watchdog, educator, and proxy functions of the press,” they write, itleaves the administration more capable of delegitimizing other institutions and constructing other enemies — including the judiciary, the intelligence community, immigrants, and members of certain races or religions.Jones and Sun contend that in many respects, Trump is reminiscent of Richard M. Nixon:Nixon, like Trump, accused the media of being out to get him and predicted that the press would mischaracterize his public support or the reception he received. He believed the liberal media to be biased against him personally, maintaining that he had “entered the presidency with less support from the major publications and TV networks than any president in history” and that “their whole objective in life is to bring us down.”Unlike Trump, however, Nixon (like the country’s founders)routinely reaffirmed to both the press and the public that he conceived of the press as central to democracy. Indeed, in his first speech to the public regarding the Watergate scandal, Nixon acknowledged that “the system that brought the facts to light and that will bring those guilty to justice” was a system that included “a vigorous free press.”Trump stands out, according to Jones and Sun, in that his administrationhas passed a threshold not approached by previous administrations in their tensions with the media. Trump is signaling — through his terminology, through his delegitimizing actions, and through his anticipatory undercutting — that the press is literally the enemy, to be distrusted, ignored, and excluded.In response to my email, Jones replied that “war has been declared, whether they (the media) like it or not.” She noted that the instincts of the pressmotivate it to want to call out the changing norms that it sees around it, and to defend the role of important democratic institutions when they are attacked. But when the press is itself one of those institutions, it finds itself a part of the story in ways that it is unaccustomed to being, and it has to weigh the potential loss of credibility that might come with an aggressive self-defense.I asked Jonathan Ladd, a professor of public policy and government at Georgetown, what strategies he thought the media should adopt to counter negative portrayals by conservatives.“The best way for the press to react to Trump’s undemocratic behavior is to continue trying to do their jobs the best they can,” Ladd wrote. “The press is not perfect, but Trump’s bad behavior doesn’t change what they need to do.”Ladd specifically warned against “reacting to Trump by becoming more crusadingly anti-Trump.”Trump has successfully “put the mainstream media in a difficult position,” according to Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago:If the media directly address the accusations of fake news, they ironically run the risk of dignifying the accusations. But if they ignore the accusations, they miss the opportunity to prove their professionalism to those who have grown skeptical.In the long term, Stone suggested, we could begin to remedy this problem if we improved civic education and encouraged a stronger defense of the media by politicians, especially Republicans — a prospect about which he is not optimistic.Of the media itself, however, Stone wrote:I don’t know that there’s really much they can do to defend themselves. Those who trust them will continue to trust them. Those who distrust them are unlikely to be brought around by anything they themselves are likely to say.Trump’s disdain for the First Amendment is an integral part of a much longer series of developments in which both parties have demonstrated a willingness to defy democratic norms, although the Republican Party has been in the forefront.In “Asymmetric Constitutional Hardball,” Joseph Fishkin and David E. Pozen, law professors at the University of Texas and Columbia, write:For a quarter of a century, Republican officials have been more willing than Democratic officials to play constitutional hardball — not only or primarily on judicial nominations but across a range of spheres. Democrats have also availed themselves of hardball throughout this period, but not with the same frequency or intensity.Fishkin and Pozen cite the work of Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, to define constitutional hardball as “political claims and practices”that are without much question within the bounds of existing constitutional doctrine and practice but that are nonetheless in some tension with existing pre-constitutional understandings. Constitutional hardball tactics are viewed by the other side as provocative and unfair because they flout the ‘goes without saying’ assumptions that underpin working systems of constitutional government. Such tactics do not generally flout binding legal norms. But that only heightens the sense of foul play insofar as it insulates acts of hardball from judicial review.Republicans on the far right, in particular, Fishkin and Pozen write, have been willing to engage in constitutional hardball because they are drawn to “narratives of debasement and restoration,” which suggestthat something has gone fundamentally awry in the republic, on the order of an existential crisis, and that unpatriotic liberals have allowed or caused it to happen.The severity of the liberal threat, in the eyes of these conservatives, justifies extreme steps to restore what they see as a besieged moral order.In an email, Fishkin wrote:As with so many things about President Trump, it strikes me that he didn’t start the fire. He got into office because it was already burning and now he’s pouring on gasoline.In Fishkin’s view, Trump will do all he can to make the conflict between his party and the press “sharper and more intense, in the same way that he depends on and aims to intensify partisan polarization.”Pozen warned in an email:Accusations that the press has a political agenda can, perversely, help create an agenda which is then said to corroborate the accusations.Pozen described Trump’s denunciation of the press as “the culmination of several decades of comparable attacks by media pundits, such as Rush Limbaugh” and he argues that Trump’s callsto lock up one’s general election opponent, encouraging online hate mobs, lying constantly, attacking the press constantly, contradicting oneself constantly, undermining the very idea of truth are individually and in common potentially profound threats to the integrity and quality of our system of free expression.The question is whether the news media can mount an effective check on the exercise of power when the media itself has become an object of hatred for a large segment of the electorate.Rosen of N.Y.U. notes the cross pressures on the news media:I think our top journalists are correct that if they become the political opposition to Trump, and see themselves that way, they lose. But they have to go to war against a political style in which power gets to write its own story.Rosen draws attention to a September 2017 article in The Atlantic, “Trump’s War Against the Media Isn’t a War: You need two sides for that,” which quotes Marty Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post: “We’re not at war; we’re at work.” Baron is right, but for those without any understanding of — or respect for — freedom of the press, first principles can be brushed aside without a second thought.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallCrucial disputes over Democratic strategy concerning economic distribution, race and immigration have in large part been based on Election Day exit polls that now appear to have been inaccurate in key ways.According to subsequent studies, those polls substantially underestimated the number of Democratic white working-class voters — many of whom are culturally conservative — and overestimated the white college-educated Democratic electorate, a far more culturally liberal constituency.“The short answer is that the exit polls are wrong,” Matthew DeBell, a senior scholar at Stanford’s Institute for Research in the Social Sciences, emailed me. He continued:In November 2016, 31.9 percent of adult US citizens had college degrees, according to the Current Population Survey. There were 138.8 million votes. To reach 50 percent of all voters, the turnout rate among college grads would have to have been 97 percent. This doesn’t pass the laugh test; no credible study has ever found turnout rates that high.The Pew Research Center and the Center for American Progress have produced methodologically sophisticated surveys of the electorate that sharply contradict 2016 exit polls.Perhaps most significant, a March 20 Pew Research Center public opinion survey found that 33 percent of Democratic voters and Democratic leaners are whites without college degrees. That’s substantially larger than the 26 percent of Democrats who are whites with college degrees — the group that many analysts had come to believe was the dominant constituency in the party.According to Pew, this noncollege white 33 percent makes up a larger bloc of the party’s voters than the 28 percent made up of racial and ethnic minorities without degrees. It is also larger than the 12 percent of Democratic voters made up of racial and ethnic minorities with college degrees.In sum, Pew’s more precise survey methods reveal that when Democrats are broken down by education, race and ethnicity, the white working class is the largest bloc of Democratic voters and substantially larger than the bloc of white college-educated Democratic voters.In a detailed analysis of the 2016 vote, Pew found that 44 percent, or 60.1 million out of a total of 136.7 million votes cast on Nov. 8, 2016 were cast by whites without college degrees — demographic shorthand for the white working class.Hillary Clinton won 28 percent of white working-class votes, according to Pew, less than Obama’s 36 percent in 2012. Still, a quarter of her total vote of 65.85 million — that is, 16.8 million votes — came from the white working class.Exit polls are routinely conducted on Election Day by Edison Research for a consortium of news organizations. In 2016, exit polls estimated that the white working class cast a total of 34 percent, or 46.5 million votes out of the 136.67 million ballots cast.The Pew study, in contrast, found that the white working class cast 44 percent, or 60.1 million votes, of all the 2016 votes for president — 13.5 million more votes than in the Edison Research exit polls.At the same time, Pew found that whites with college degrees made up 30 percent of the total electorate, not the 37 percent reported in the exit polls. In other words, Pew found that white working-class voters outnumbered white college voters among all voters, while the exit polls reported just the opposite.These numbers have powerful ramifications for both Democrats and Republicans preparing for the 2018 and 2020 elections.By showing that the white working class makes up a larger proportion of the electorate than previously reported, the Pew report — taken together with similar results in a study sponsored in November 2017 by the liberal Center for American Progress — strengthens the case made by Democratic strategists calling for a greater emphasis on policies appealing to working class voters and a de-emphasis on so-called identity issues.The Center for American Progress study by Rob Griffin, Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin foundthat exit polls radically overestimated the share of white college-educated voters and radically underestimated the share of white non-college-educated voters. While the exit polls claimed that white college graduates actually outnumbered non-college-educated white voters at the polls in 2016, 37 to 34 percent, CAP’s data indicate a vastly different story: White college graduates were only about 29 percent of voters, while their non-college-educated counterparts far outdistanced them at 45 percent of voters.I asked Scott Keeter, a senior research adviser at Pew, and Ruth Igielnik, a research associate there, to provide a comparison of 2016 election demographics in the Pew survey data with those in the exit poll data. There were crucial differences, especially in the case of college and noncollege whites.Edison exit polls taken on Nov. 8 had Clinton failing to carry college-educated whites, losing them to Trump (49-45). Pew found that she did in fact win these voters, decisively carrying white college grads, 55-38.According to the November exit polls, half of the entire 2016 electorate of all races had college degrees; Pew found that such well-educated voters were a much smaller 37 percent.I asked Joe Lenski, co-founder and executive vice president of Edison Research — the organization which conducts exit polling — about the differences with Pew over demographics. In a phone interview, Lenski said the firm interviews voters as they leave polling places and by phone to make sure those casting early or mail ballots are included.“We are all circling around the absolute truth, but we are all using methodologies that have their problems,” he said. Asked if he thought Pew raised legitimate questions about the exit polling, especially on the shares of college and noncollege voters, Lenski said that all surveys “have their errors,” adding that there “are sampling errors, nonresponse errors.”Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, specializes in political polling. The major problem with exit polls, he wrote in an email, is thatit is very difficult to weight an exit poll to the target population, especially on the night of the election. The reason is that we don’t know yet what the electorate’s demographics will be when the voting is happening. The best that exit pollsters can do is record the approximate age, race, and gender of people who refuse to take the survey (based on what the exit pollster thinks they look like), but this only allows them to weight on three variables, and these factors aren’t even measured very precisely.The problems of the Edison exit polls are widely recognized in the political science community, but rarely discussed in the media. Robert Y. Shapiro, a political scientist at Columbia, noted that thebiases in the exit polls before they are weighted for the actual vote are well known — they have overrepresented Democratic voters and also now also the better educated who are more likely to vote Democratic.Christopher Achen, a political scientist at Princeton, wrote me:The exit polls have traditionally overrepresented college grads, and even more dramatically postgrads, probably because less-educated people are less inclined to respond to the interviewers unless they are particularly enthusiastic about a candidate and want to say so.He added that “when I read the Pew report, I thought it was very likely right.”Ted Brader, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, also emailed:the issue with the education distribution is that exit polls could provide, at best, a representative sample of those who turn out to vote, not a representative sample of the voting eligible US population.Such Election Day polling Brader wrote, is “intended for specific purposes that may not make them even a very good representative sample of those who voted.” Instead, Brader argued, exit polls are “organized principally by news organizations who want to be able to make election night ‘calls’ of winners as soon as they can, and also need to fill the airtime those evenings with commentary by talking heads.” The primary goal of exit polls, thus, “is not to provide a representative portrait of the whole electorate.”Because of their limitations, Brader wrote, “social scientists rarely turn to exit polls to study voting behavior.”My colleague Nate Cohn, writing for The Upshot, has twice addressed problems in exit polling, first on June 9, 2016, then again on Feb. 27, 2018.Cohn argued that the exit polls overestimated “Trump’s support among well-educated white voters” and thatthere is no question that the exit polls underestimate the number of white working-class voters, especially older ones, by a considerable amount.Cohn observed that errors result from “an odd methodological quirk in exit polling” that “winds up biasing the rest of the survey because the exit polls are weighted to match the actual result of a far less educated country.” The net effect:The exit poll overestimates Republican support among most demographic groups, including well-educated white voters, and it overestimates the number of voters from Democratic-leaning voting blocs, like young, nonwhite and well-educated voters.Assuming this critique of the exit polls is correct, what are the implications for Democrats and Republicans?For Democrats, the Pew and CAP calculations suggest that because the noncollege white vote remains highly significant, the party and its candidates need to prevent any further erosion in this constituency that went so strongly for Trump.The corollary for Republicans is that the party, already behind in the popular vote, cannot afford to suffer continued losses among college-educated white voters, especially college-educated women. Pew found by 2017, a year into the Trump presidency:Voters who have completed college make up a third of all registered voters. And a majority — 58 percent — of all voters with at least a four-year college degree now identifies as Democrats or leans Democratic, the highest share dating back to 1992. Just 36 percent affiliate with the Republican Party or lean toward the G.O.P.This danger has become more acute, according to the Pew study:The share of women identifying as Democrats or leaning Democratic is up 4 percentage points since 2015 and is at one of its highest points since 1992.At the same time, though, Trump appears to be strengthening Republican support among noncollege whites:Voters with no college experience have been moving toward the GOP: 47 percent identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, up from 42 percent in 2014.The Pew and CAP studies received relatively little publicity compared to the massive coverage of the exit polls, raising the question of how much the political community will adjust to the conflicting data.Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who studies the intricacies of polling, is not optimistic:In real time on election night, the exit polls set a narrative, and for a long time there is no other data that changes that narrative, and that narrative solidifies into place and it’s really hard to get past it.Polling that provides an inaccurate picture of the electorate does more than undermine partisan strategy and media analysis. Trevor Tompson, vice president of NORC (formerly the National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago, emailed me:The overrepresentation of college-educated voters, and especially those with postgraduate degrees, has long been a known issue with the in-person exit poll.He then added:The bottom line is we need to have much better data for the health of our democracy.For Democrats, these questions are a matter of competitive survival.Teixeira of the Center for American Politics and William Galston of The Brookings Institution, two longtime Democratic strategists, suggest different but complementary directions in which to take the Democratic Party going forward.Galston, writing in the March 16 Wall Street Journal, argues that Democrats need to moderate their stand on immigration in order to win over white noncollege voters.“No issue has done more than immigration to feed populism, and finding a sustainable compromise would drain much of the bile from today’s politics,” Galston writes. He continues:Defenders of liberal democracy should acknowledge that controlling borders is a legitimate exercise of sovereignty, and that the appropriate number and type of immigrants is a legitimate subject for debate. Denouncing citizens concerned about immigration as bigots ameliorates neither the substance nor the politics of the problem. There’s nothing illiberal about the view that too many immigrants stress a country’s capacity to absorb them, so that a reduction or even a pause may be in order.Teixeira points out that if Clinton had done as well with white working-class voters as Obamashe would have carried, with robust margins, the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Iowa, as well as Florida and Ohio. In fact, if Clinton could simply have reduced the shift toward Donald Trump among these voters by one-quarter, she would have won.In Alabama’s special Senate election, Doug Jones, the winning Democrat, would have lost if he had not made substantial inroads with the white working class, Teixeira argued:Without the hefty swing among the white non-college population, particularly women, there is no way Jones would have won the state, or even come close.Teixeira concluded:There is no way around it — if Democrats hope to be competitive in Ohio and similar states in 2020, they must do the hard thing: find a way to reach hearts and minds among white non-college voters.Let’s go back to Galston, writing on the Brookings website, presciently, in June 2016. I will quote him at some length, because in my opinion no one captures the situation better than he does:Most working-class whites have incomes below $50,000; most whites with BAs or more have incomes above $50,000. Most working-class whites rate their financial circumstances as only fair or poor; most college educated whites rate their financial circumstances as good or excellent. Fifty-four percent of working-class whites think of themselves as working class or lower class, compared to only 18 percent of better-educated whites ….In many respects, these two groups of white voters see the world very differently. For example, 54 percent of college-educated whites think that America’s culture and way of life have improved since the 1950s; 62 percent of white working-class Americans think that it has changed for the worse. Sixty-eight percent of working-class whites, but only 47 percent of college-educated whites, believe that the American way of life needs to be protected against foreign influences. Sixty-six percent of working-class whites, but only 43 percent of college-educated whites, say that discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities. In a similar vein, 62 percent of working-class whites believe that discrimination against Christians has become as big a problem as discrimination against other groups, a proposition only 38 percent of college educated whites endorse.This brings us to the issue of immigration. By a margin of 52 to 35 percent, college-educated whites affirm that today’s immigrants strengthen our country through their talent and hard work. Conversely, 61 percent of white working-class voters say that immigrants weaken us by taking jobs, housing, and health care. Seventy-one percent of working-class whites think that immigrants mostly hurt the economy by driving down wages, a belief endorsed by only 44 percent of college-educated whites. Fifty-nine percent of working-class whites believe that we should make a serious effort to deport all illegal immigrants back to their home countries; only 33 percent of college-educated whites agree. Fifty-five percent of working-class whites think we should build a wall along our border with Mexico, while 61 percent of whites with BAs or more think we should not. Majorities of working-class whites believe that we should make the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States illegal and temporarily ban the entrance of non-American Muslims into our country; about two-thirds of college-educated whites oppose each of these proposals.Opinions on trade follow a similar pattern. By a narrow margin of 48 to 46 percent, college-educated whites endorse the view that trade agreements are mostly helpful to the United States because they open up overseas markets while 62 percent of working-class whites believe that they are harmful because they send jobs overseas and drive down wages.It is understandable that working-class whites are more worried that they or their families will become victims of violent crime than are whites with more education. After all, they are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher levels of social disorder and criminal behavior. It is harder to explain why they are also much more likely to believe that their families will fall victim to terrorism. To be sure, homegrown terrorist massacres of recent years have driven home the message that it can happen to anyone, anywhere. We still need to explain why working-class whites have interpreted this message in more personal terms.The most plausible interpretation is that working-class whites are experiencing a pervasive sense of vulnerability. On every front — economic, cultural, personal security — they feel threatened and beleaguered. They seek protection against all the forces they perceive as hostile to their cherished way of life — foreign people, foreign goods, foreign ideas, aided and abetted by a government they no longer believe cares about them. Perhaps this is why fully 60 percent of them are willing to endorse a proposition that in previous periods would be viewed as extreme: the country has gotten so far off track that we need a leader who is prepared to break some rules if that is what it takes to set things right.The bottom line, as the 2016 election amply demonstrated, is that if the Democratic Party does not take the bull by the horns, someone else will.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

Reich 193 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $22.95.In recent decades, American public discourse has become hollow and shrill. Instead of morally robust debates about the common good, we have shouting matches on talk radio and cable television, and partisan food fights in Congress. People argue past one another, without really listening or seeking to persuade.This condition has diminished the public’s regard for political parties and politicians, and also given rise to a danger: A politics empty of moral argument creates a vacuum of meaning that is often filled by the vengeful certitudes of strident nationalism. This danger now hovers over American politics. More than a year into the presidency of Donald Trump, however, liberals and progressives have yet to articulate a politics of the common good adequate to the country’s predicament.Robert B. Reich’s new book, “The Common Good,” is a welcome response to this challenge. One of the most prominent voices among progressives, Reich has written insightfully about the changing nature of work brought about by globalization and the growing inequality it has generated. He served as secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, but in 2016 endorsed Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton.Reich’s book diagnoses the decline of the common good in American life and suggests ways of restoring it. He begins by observing that even the term has fallen into disuse: “The common good is no longer a fashionable idea. The phrase is rarely uttered today, not even by commencement speakers and politicians.”Reich defines the common good as consisting in “our shared values about what we owe one another as citizens who are bound together in the same society.” What binds us as Americans, he argues, is not birth or ethnicity but a commitment to fundamental ideals and principles: respect for the rule of law and democratic institutions, toleration of our differences and belief in equal political rights and equal opportunity.These ideals and principles, Reich says, are not political, at least not in the partisan sense; to affirm them is not to take sides in debates between Democrats and Republicans. “We passionately disagree about all manner of things. But we must share these commitments to each other because they are — or have been — what makes us a people.”Reich attributes the erosion of the common good in recent decades to the breakdown of moral restraint in the pursuit of power and money. In Washington, the “whatever-it-takes-to-win politics” that began in the Nixon years has led to the hyperpartisanship of today. In the corporate world, the single-minded pursuit of shareholder value has displaced the older notion that companies are responsible for the well-being of workers, customers and the communities they serve.The unbridled pursuit of power and profit has brought an enormous flow of corporate money into politics. The result is a rigged system that perpetuates inequality, enables economic elites to manipulate the rules of the game to their own advantage, undermines trust in institutions and promotes attitudes of unrestrained self-seeking in social life generally.There are several ways to revive the common good, Reich suggests. One is to recover the notion of leadership as trusteeship. Corporate executives should recognize responsibilities beyond maximizing profits, and public officials should resist the scorched-earth, anything-goes approach to politics. The essence of Trump’s failure as a leader, according to Reich, is “not that he has chosen one set of policies over another, or has divided rather than united Americans, or even that he has behaved in childish and vindictive ways unbecoming a president. It is that he has sacrificed the processes and institutions of American democracy to achieve his goals.”Reich also calls for a greater emphasis on civic education, including two years of mandatory public service, and efforts to resurrect truth from the miasma of political deceit and fake news. Perhaps the most distinctive measure Reich proposes is the redeployment of honor and shame. Rather than honor people for their wealth or celebrity, we should honor those who display genuine virtue, like whistle-blowers, firefighters, social workers and soldiers — people who perform hard or risky tasks that serve the common good. And we should shame those who, however wealthy, achieve their status through exploitative business practices or morally dubious financial dealings.Interestingly, in developing this theme, Reich favorably cites so-called “virtue conservatives” of the 1980s and 1990s. For example, he quotes William J. Bennett, the education secretary in the Reagan administration, who warned that “nonjudgmentalism … has permeated our culture, encouraging a paralysis of the moral faculty.” He also cites the conservative political scientist James Q. Wilson, who argued that neglecting broken windows in poor communities conveys a message of moral license, leading to an unraveling of social restraints and increased crime. Reich contends that people who get rich by exploiting norms of social trust — by evading taxes, say, or devising barely legal schemes of financial trickery — generate a similar unraveling.Against the grain of much liberal thinking, Reich acknowledges that promoting civic virtue requires being judgmental about what moral attitudes and qualities of character our public life should affirm and promote. This recognition of the role of moral judgment in politics is an important corrective to the liberal wariness of bringing morality into the public square.Reich’s proposals would make a good starting point for a new progressive political project. What is puzzling, however, is his insistence that a politics of the common good can or should be nonpartisan. Time and again, he draws a sharp distinction between the common good he wants to revive and the competing conceptions of the common good at stake in everyday political debate — about tax policy, health care, the environment and so on. He insists his book is not about what messages Democrats or Republicans should convey or what policies they should pursue, but rather about restoring our shared commitment to democratic norms and principles. “It’s our agreement to these principles that connects us, not agreement about where these principles lead.”Reich seems to believe that the common good describes ground rules for a decent society, not the policies and purposes that citizens should pursue within these ground rules. But is it really possible to separate the two? Is the debate over how vigorously to regulate Wall Street about the ground rules of democracy or a policy on which Democrats and Republicans may reasonably disagree? Or consider immigration. Reich argues that the common good is “not about securing borders, erecting walls and keeping others out …. To the contrary, the common good is about inclusion — joining together to achieve common goals.” But inclusion of whom — existing citizens of the country, Dreamers, other immigrants who hope to be admitted? Partisans on all sides of this raging debate invoke competing conceptions of the common good to support their position.As these examples suggest, the nonpartisan, above-the-fray conception of the common good that Reich proposes may be too high-minded to reinvigorate American public discourse in the way he wants. In the face of President Trump’s serial violations of democratic norms, it is tempting to appeal to Americans, whatever their party or political persuasion, to reaffirm certain principles that all can share. But such principles, if truly detached from debate about where they lead, are so abstract that they can only serve as hortatory fare for commencement addresses and the Fourth of July. The best hope for reviving the common good is to invigorate moral argument in the messy, contentious domain of democratic politics.Michael J.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBy Myles E. JohnsonMr. Johnson is the author of the children’s book “Large Fears.”Beyoncé is at the pinnacle of her career. At the Coachella festival in the Southern California desert on Saturday, she showed that there’s nothing this mother of three can’t do. But she didn’t just kill the performance; she also rewrote the book on black respectability politics. She could have decided to play to the majority-white audience with a show that made it easier to forget cultural differences. Or she could be herself. Beyoncé chose the latter.In putting on a show that celebrated the diversity of black people, she conveyed that no matter how much fame or money she has, she will refuse to divorce herself from black culture, even the parts that are underappreciated, disrespected or misunderstood by white people. Beyoncé was performing her music, but she was also saying that the performance of respectability — the policing of black people’s behavior and appearance to better appeal to white people — is an oppression we don’t need in our lives.Black musicians in particular have long been told how they should look and perform to sustain their success and be marketable to a larger audience. That often meant that black artists distanced themselves from the things associated with black culture, especially the things that might be coded as not-respectable.[Receive the day’s biggest conversations right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] Whitney Houston famously struggled under this weight. At the urging of her mentor Clive Davis and others, she wore glamorous clothes, sang pop-driven songs instead of R&B and obeyed other unwritten social norms that circumscribed how she could live her life and express herself.Michael Jackson, Oprah Winfrey and President Barack Obama have all been accused of staying aloof from black culture to gain more power and be more relatable to a wider, whiter audience. It is a common belief among black people that the more successful we become, the more we should keep away from black culture — especially when white people are looking. And especially at work.Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Lawson, echoed this sentiment before her daughter’s performance: “I told Beyoncé that I was afraid that the predominately white audience at Coachella would be confused by all of the black culture and black college culture because it was something that they might not get,” she wrote on Instagram.But Beyoncé assuaged her fears. “I have worked very hard to get to the point where I have a true voice,” Ms. Lawson recalls her daughter saying. “And at this point in my life and my career, I have a responsibility to do what’s best for the world and not what is most popular.”It would have made sense if Beyoncé decided to perform songs that were more culturally ambiguous, as to not alienate the people she was hired to entertain. However, before a mostly white audience, Beyoncé sang “Lift Every Voice,” widely regarded as the black national anthem. That song melted into “Formation,” her own pro-black anthem, where she talks about loving “Negro” noses and positions herself as a black Bill Gates.She also amplified Malcolm X’s famous words about black women: “The most disrespected woman in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.” This centering of black womanhood is not what black people have been taught to do when given as much power and attention as Beyoncé has.It would have been reasonable to assume Beyoncé would perform the entire show in a glamorous couture number, like the Nefertiti-inspired costume she came onstage in. Respectability is also imagery: Black people are told, when we gain power, and are under the gaze of the public, we must always wear our most formal and elegant attire.Instead, with millions of people watching in the desert and online, Beyoncé reappeared in blue distressed denim shorts and a hoodie advertising a fake historically black college. Success does not need to have a preferred style; a black person does not have to wear a glamorous gown or a tailored suit to captivate the imagination of the public. Beyoncé shows that talent and discipline are enough.She follows in the tradition of black performers like Michael Jackson and Tina Turner, but she is unique in imagining blackness as something so big. To Beyoncé, attending a historically black college is more than a niche experience coveted only by students and alumni. Instead, it’s something thematically paramount and worthy of an enormous stadium.You might think that Beyoncé’s promotion of historically black colleges and their intellectual traditions also might have conflicted with her sexually charged songs like “Partition” and “Drunk in Love.” We’re taught that an intellectual being can never be sexual one. This is especially true for black people who have been hypersexualized in media and daily life. So it wouldn’t have been odd for her to edit her sexuality to fit society’s ideas of what it means to be proud, black and smart.Not at Coachella. Beyoncé performed her sensuality proudly in those songs making political statement that a person can be both intellectually rigorous and sexually expressive.We know Beyoncé can sing and move, and that she treats stadiums as if they are her living room. But it wasn’t clear whether, after Clive Davis called her “the first lady of music,” she would adhere to respectability politics, especially on a stage like Coachella, where she may have alienated a large portion of her audience. The easier route would have been cultural ambiguity. But excellence is found in risk, and Beyoncé has proved to be an artist most interested in excellence.All black people should follow her lead and refuse to shrink blackness. Black people often negotiate how much of ourselves we should show to make others comfortable. Black people often feel the need to edit parts of our culture and upbringing for the sake of appearing respectable — that is, of course, until our music and style are appropriated by the very people we were attempting to not alienate.Beyoncé’s Coachella performance suggests that, as black people’s power grows, we should intentionally amplify the culture that nurtured us. This anti-respectability politics that Beyoncé brought to the stage is what transformed her performance into a political statement.Mr. Johnson (@hausmuva) is the author of the children’s book “Large Fears.”Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Lisa W. FoderaroIn a special election in New York that was thought to hold the key to Democrats’ capturing the State Senate, Shelley B. Mayer, the Democratic candidate, sailed to victory in Westchester County on Tuesday, buoyed by a large turnout of progressive voters angered by the Trump presidency.Ms. Mayer, a state assemblywoman from Yonkers, defeated her Republican challenger, Julie Killian, a deputy mayor of Rye, in the 37th District, which covers much of the eastern portion of the county. With 78 percent of districts counted, Ms. Mayer led Ms. Killian, 58 percent to 42 percent.Her victory — coupled with another Democratic win in a special election in the 32nd Senate District in the Bronx — gave the Democrats a theoretical one-vote edge over the Republicans in the Senate, 32 to 31.But theory gave way earlier on Tuesday to Simcha Felder, a Democrat of Brooklyn who has caucused with Republicans.Mr. Felder announced that he had decided to continue his relationship with Republicans, thus allowing the party to retain its Senate majority by one vote.Both Democrats and Republicans had spent millions of dollars on the Westchester contest, airing hostile television ads, in an effort to win the seat, which was vacated in January by George Latimer, who won his bid for county executive. Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one in the county, but Ms. Killian mounted an energetic campaign.The importance of the race was underscored by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s involvement in the race: He stumped for Ms. Mayer in Mamaroneck on Sunday morning to help get out the vote, and was at her election watch party on Tuesday night.“All of us are part of something bigger, a movement for change, a blue wave rising in special election after special election,” Ms. Mayer said in a statement released after she declared victory. “This race was about finally bringing a Democratic majority to the State Senate so that New York can once again be a progressive leader.”Progressive activists pledged to work even harder to unseat Republicans in the Senate this fall to give Democrats an unassailable edge.“We are committed to flipping the I.D.C. seats and, following that, flipping red seats to blue,” Lisa DellAquila, a leader of True Blue NY, a liberal activist group, said in a phone interview on Tuesday, referring to the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of breakaway Democrats who have since reconciled with their party. “I am confident that we can really make an impact in those areas and create a solid Democratic majority.”While campaigning feverishly to ensure that Ms. Mayer, 64, would conquer Ms. Killian, 57, in Westchester, Democrats had been less worried about the special election for State Senate in the South Bronx. In that race, Luis R. Sepúlveda, a Democratic assemblyman, handily won the 32nd District, dispatching his Republican rival, Patrick Delices, and a Reform Party candidate, Pamela Stewart-Martinez.In addition, nine vacant Assembly seats, from Long Island to South Buffalo, were decided in the special election. But with Democrats in charge of the Assembly by huge margins, those outcomes would not change the balance of power there.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Quinta JurecicMs. Jurecic is the managing editor of Lawfare.A few short but very long days in the life of the Trump presidency: On Wednesday night, Rudy Giuliani, a newly minted member of the president’s legal team, acknowledged on national television that Mr. Trump had been aware of his personal lawyer Michael Cohen’s $130,000 payment to an adult film actress on Mr. Trump’s behalf — contradicting the president’s previous claims. Mr. Trump promptly attempted damage control by tweet to ward off speculation that the payment to Stephanie Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, might have constituted a violation of campaign finance law. Though the president’s tweets seemed to confirm Mr. Giuliani’s account of events, on Friday Mr. Trump hinted that his lawyer needed to “get his facts straight.”Mr. Giuliani’s comments came only a few hours after news broke out that another of Mr. Trump’s attorneys would retire from the legal team handling the Russia investigation — the second to depart in six weeks. The previous day, the president’s personal doctor accused Mr. Trump’s former bodyguard and others of “raiding” his office and removing Mr. Trump’s medical records, while Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, deflected questions about a New York Times story listing in detail a range of subjects about which Robert Mueller, the special counsel, is seeking to interview the president. Through it all, Mr. Trump fumed on Twitter over the “Russian witch hunt.”So goes a normal week in 2018. The push alerts ping. The tweets stack up. Arguments over constitutional law and attorney-client privilege fill the airwaves. The noise roars so loudly and from so many different sources that however much we strain to listen, it’s next to impossible to make sense out of it.Or to put it another way: Does any of this matter?Probably. But the unsatisfying answer is that we don’t know — and we really don’t know which parts will end up mattering in the long run. As the litigations and investigations move forward, though, it’s worth taking a step back and considering the various legal fronts on which the president is fighting simultaneously — filtering out as much noise from the signal as we can so the stakes are clear. Think of what follows as a cheat sheet to the legal circus surrounding the White House.The Mueller investigationThe special counsel’s investigation into Russian election interference is made up of several different threads — and each, as far as we know, could pose a degree of danger to the president. Mr. Trump can probably rest easy that he won’t be indicted — not necessarily because of a clean legal bill of health, but because internal Justice Department guidelines bar the indictment of a sitting president, and the famously by-the-book Mr. Mueller is unlikely to pursue charges. So any untimely end to his presidency would probably come through impeachment.Though impeachment has a legal flavor, in practice it’s a matter of politics. Congress would need to mutiny, and while Mr. Trump’s approval ratings are bad, they are not bad at all among Republicans, which makes impeachment unlikely for now, given Republican control of both the House and the Senate.Election interferenceThis is at the center of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, but it remains distant from the president himself. The Russian effort involved two prongs: first, the use of social media to spread disinformation and discord; and second, the hacking and leaking of emails belonging to the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The special counsel laid out a comprehensive case on the former in the indictment of Russians affiliated with “information warfare against the United States.” The indictment does describe how Russians posing as Americans reached out to Trump campaign officials, but Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took pains to emphasize that “there is no allegation in this indictment that any American had any knowledge” of Russian activities.There’s also the hacking, on which Mr. Mueller has so far been silent. But the main legal theory on which he indicted the Russians — the conspiracy to defraud the United States — could theoretically expand to net both Russians and Americans involved in the hack-and-leak operation.Campaign and administration contacts with RussiansPeople close to the president had an unusual habit of meeting with Russian officials or individuals linked to the Russian government. The foreign policy adviser Carter Page — who, we now know, was later monitored by the F.B.I. as a possible Russian agent — might have been nothing more than a hanger-on, but there’s also Jared Kushner, Donald Trump Jr., Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, all of whom became entangled with Moscow-linked contacts. Mr. Papadopoulos is cooperating with the Mueller team and has acknowledged learning of Russia’s possession of “thousands of emails” about Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile, there’s the notorious Trump Tower meeting in which Mr. Trump Jr. apparently expected to receive incriminating information on Mrs. Clinton.That’s a lot of smoke, and we know the special counsel is looking into it: According to The Times, the subjects about which Mr. Mueller wants to interview the president include many questions about collusion. What we don’t know is whether Mr. Mueller has found any fire or whether any smoke reaches the Oval Office.Obstruction of justiceThis is the thread of the Mueller investigation that, so far, most directly implicates the president. Mr. Trump has reportedly tried to undermine the Russia investigation from the very beginning by trying to push James Comey, the F.B.I. director, to drop the bureau’s probe into Mr. Flynn (which Trump denies) before firing Mr. Comey. He then apparently considered (two times that we know of) firing the special counsel as well — and that’s only the start of it. Mr. Mueller is reportedly preparing a write-up on Mr. Trump’s possible attempts at obstruction and considers the president to be a “subject” rather than a “target” (the latter is a person the F.B.I. is planning to indict) but that doesn’t mean Mr. Trump should rest easy.Obstruction requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted intentionally to impede a proceeding. That’s why it’s notable that so many of Mr. Mueller’s potential questions for Mr. Trump seem to aim at determining the president’s state of mind in dismissing Mr. Comey and pressuring Mr. Sessions not to recuse himself from the investigation. Keep in mind that Congress listed obstruction of justice among the articles of impeachment for both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.The Cohen investigationWe know that Mr. Mueller is investigating various threads of possible financial wrongdoing by those around the president. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates have been indicted on charges including money laundering, tax evasion and bank fraud, and reports indicate that the special counsel may also be looking into Mr. Kushner’s business dealings during the presidential transition not only with Russians but also with Qatar, Turkey, China and the United Arab Emirates.White-collar crime also appears to be central to the investigation into Mr. Cohen, whose office and residences were raided by law enforcement in April. The probe is apparently important enough to the president that Mr. Trump sent his own lawyer to argue alongside Mr. Cohen’s in a preliminary court battle.Theoretically, Mr. Cohen’s involvement with the Trump family’s work in real estate means that prosecutors digging into his finances might unearth information on the president’s businesses as well. There’s also the matter of Mr. Cohen’s payments to Ms. Clifford in exchange for her silence on an alleged affair with Mr. Trump, and his reported involvement in trying to quash other negative stories, possibly including the “Access Hollywood” tape.But the real danger of the Cohen investigation, so far as the president is concerned, may simply be that the investigations into Mr. Trump’s inner circle have grown beyond the scope of Mr. Mueller’s probe alone. The special counsel reportedly referred the Cohen case to federal prosecutors in the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. And that means that even if Mr. Trump fires the special counsel, his legal problems will not go away.Civil lawsuitsThe government investigations and prosecutions aren’t the only action. The president is personally being sued by Ms. Clifford — she is suing Mr. Trump for defamation and seeking release from her nondisclosure agreement on her alleged relationship with him — and by Summer Zervos, a former “Apprentice” contestant who argues that Mr. Trump defamed her when he called her story of being sexually harassed by him a lie. (The other legal proceedings described here are federal, but Ms. Zervos’s case is before the New York Supreme Court.) Then there are two lawsuits over the hacking and leaking of Democratic National Committee emails: One was brought by the committee itself and the other by donors and a former staffer who claim that their privacy was invaded.Mr. Trump isn’t a defendant in the latter two cases — but they still implicate his business ties and his conduct on the campaign trail. The real risk to the president will most likely come if these lawsuits can make it to the phase in which the plaintiffs can start requesting information and testimony from Mr. Trump and those around him. Remember that the “discovery phase” in the Paula Jones case was ultimately what set in motion President Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings.***The jokes of 2018 are all about nihilism: “Nothing matters!” we cheerfully, or not so cheerfully, declare. This is at its truest and most despairing when it comes to the legal chaos around the president. Perhaps none of this means anything, as Mr. Trump and many of his supporters believe. Or perhaps all of it will one day turn out to have meant everything — to the president, to the presidency, to the country.Meanwhile, the president rages. And Mr. Mueller is nearing the one-year mark of his appointment as special counsel.Quinta Jurecic (@qjurecic) is the managing editor of Lawfare.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the  Opinion Today newsletter.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.During President Trump’s formative years, Queens — the New York City “outer borough” in which he grew up — was transformed from an all-white enclave into a racial and ethnic battleground. The forces unleashed in those struggles shaped Trump’s current policies on both immigration and racial integration.Trump was born on June 14, 1946. Until he was four, he lived in a two-story mock Tudor home built by his father, Fred, just south of Grand Central Parkway in Jamaica Estates.In 1950, Donald and his family moved around the corner to a grander 23-room, 9-bathroom redbrick — also built by his father — at 85-14 Midland Parkway.“The Jamaica Estates of Mr. Trump’s boyhood was an exclusive and nearly all-white place, resistant to outsiders and largely impenetrable to minorities,” The Times reported in 2015. In fact, the 1950 census found that at that time, 96.5 percent of the 1.55 million Queens residents were white.Taken together, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 — with attendant white flight — drove the upheavals that converted Queens into one of the most diverse counties in the nation. To those who love it, it is a vital, dynamic, multicultural community of people who enrich one another’s lives in myriad ways. To Trump, residents of modern American inner cities are “living in hell.”In 1960, when Trump turned 14, there were so few Hispanics that the census did not keep count; by 1970, when Trump turned 24, 153,691, or one out of 13, Queens residents were Latino. From 1960 to 1970, the black population of Queens grew from 145,885 to 258,006.By the start of the 1970s, Queens communities like Howard Beach, Corona and Forest Hills became racial combat zones as Mayor John Lindsay sought to build scatter-site public housing in white middle and working-class neighborhoods.Forest Hills, for example — 10 minutes away from Jamaica Estates — became, in the words of this newspaper, the focal point of “one of the most controversial projects in the 38?year?old history of the nation’s public housing program.”Signs protesting a proposed affordable housing high-rise proclaimed: “Adolf Lindsay — the middle class will bury you.”Jerry Birbach, a leader of the protests, declared:In my opinion no high?rise, low?income housing works out. What happens is it becomes a concentration camp for the elderly where eventually you can’t go out for a loaf of bread or a bottle of milk. Why don’t they build gas chambers for these people?For Trump, the civil rights movement became an intensely personal matter in 1973, two years after he was named president of his father’s firm, the Trump Management Company. In October of that year, the Justice Department charged the company with discrimination against African-Americans at the organization’s rental housing buildings. The firm’s agents secretly put codes such as “No. 9” and “C” for “colored” on applications from minorities.The Trumps, with the aid of Roy Cohn — Trump’s all-purpose lawyer and counselor — bitterly fought the Justice Department, but in 1975 the company settled. The agreement barred the Trump Management Company from “discriminating against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling.” In addition, the settlement required the Trumps to “thoroughly acquaint themselves personally on a detailed basis” with civil rights law.By July 2016, when Trump had defied the odds and wrestled the presidential nomination away from 16 mainstream Republicans, Queens had become one of the most diverse counties in the country. The white share of the Queens population had fallen to 25.3 percent; almost half of the residents, 47.5 percent, were foreign-born; Hispanics, at 28 percent of the population, outnumbered whites; Asian-Americans made up 26.7 percent; and African-Americans made up 20.7 percent.Jamaica Estates, ZIP code 11432, where Trump spent his childhood and youth, underwent an even greater transformation. By 2010, the residents were 38.4 percent Asian, 24.9 percent Hispanic, 22 percent black, and 14.4 percent white, according to the census.And by 2016, Queens was no longer Trump turf. He won 21.8 percent of the borough’s voters while Hillary Clinton swept it with 75.4 percent.Donald Trump “grew up in white America,” a former neighbor of the Trumps, told The Times in 2015. “It’s the way of the world; white America is a thing of the past. The white man’s gone.”I asked Robert Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard, about the link between Trump’s roots in Queens and his policies as president. Sampson replied by email: “My immediate reaction is that it was no accident that ‘All in the Family’ was set in Queens,” Sampson wrote, just as Steve Bannon used to say about his former boss, “Dude, he is Archie Bunker.”Sampson pointed out the connection between Trump’s roots in Queens and the themes he has stressed as a candidate and as president:The explosion of immigration and the racial change in the makeup of Queens might have left an especially deep imprint, because his constant references to making America great again evoke an earlier time that was considerably less diverse. Indeed, building walls and stemming the tide of such change seems to be at the heart of Trump’s appeals to a remembered national past, and in this case, of his childhood.Sampson cited thestrong link research has found between perceptions of disorder and the presence of immigrants and minorities — independent of actual disorder and crime — provides another clue, one that applies to neighborhoods and arguably up to the level of societies.Jennifer Richeson, a psychologist at Yale, emailed me about her perception that “shifting demographics of one’s town can certainly engender more negative intergroup attitudes and perception.”In a forthcoming paper summarizing research on the effect of growing diversity on white attitudes, “The Pitfalls and Promise of Increasing Racial Diversity,” Richeson, Maureen A. Craig, and Julian M. Rucker, psychologists at N.Y.U. and Yale, write:Whites for whom the changing national diversity is salient express (a) more support for conservative policies, including those relevant to race; (b) less support for diversity; (c) more racial resentment and support for the Tea Party; and (d) more support for Donald Trump and anti-immigrant policies.Trump has long since departed Queens, along with more than 900,000 other whites, many of whom became recruits for his presidential campaign. His administration is in many respects an attempt to restore the Queens of his early childhood.Anthony Scaramucci, a friend of the president’s who served 10 days as the White House communications director, grasped Trump’s outer borough appeal to many voters. In a recent interview with Ed Luce of The Financial Times, Scaramucci argued that Trump understood that “America’s ‘aspirational’ working class had become ‘desperational’.”During the campaign, Scaramucci recounted, Trump “would say to us: ‘That tweet’s not for you. You’re probably offended by it. I don’t care. That tweet is for the guy in the flyover states, at the steel plant. If I lose some of the effete Republican elite, what difference does it make?’ ”Luce reports the story of Trump telling foreign investors that his casinos would be flooded by “white trash.” What did he mean by “white trash,” the investors asked.Trump replied: “They’re people just like me, only they’re poor.”Trump is nothing if not consistent in his appeal to this constituency.As recently as April 5, in an appearance in West Virginia, Trump repeated his description of migrants from Mexico as rapists and alleged that “millions and millions” of undocumented immigrants voted against him in the 2016 election.“We cannot let people enter our country,” Trump said:We have no idea who they are, what they do, where they came from. We have no idea what their records are. We don’t know if they’re murderers, if they’re killers, if they’re MS-13.Citing his upbringing in Queens, Trump boasted that federal immigration enforcement officershave gone into towns in Long Island where we’ve taken MS-13 and we’ve actually liberated towns. This is our country, right? I grew up in Long Island, right short of Long Island. And these are great towns; I know every one of them.Trump relishes gory descriptions of the dangers posed by illegal immigrants:They didn’t want to use guns. They use knives because it’s much more painful, where they cut people up, because a bullet is too quick. They want to inflict pain on students, on young women, young girls walking home. And their parents never see them again. They’re cut up.Trump’s views are succinctly expressed in the  decision of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in February to abandon the country’s commitment to “America’s promise as a nation of immigrants.” In its place, the agency’s mission statement promises to “efficiently and fairly” adjudicate immigration applications “while protecting Americans, securing the homeland and honoring our values.”Trump’s views on race and ethnicity find a wide range of targets. He is conducting a subterranean assault on housing integration — the subject of his family’s court battles in the 1970s. He has delegated the issue to Ben Carson, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development.The most significant decision Carson has made is an attempt to undercut, if not gut, one of the most far-reaching regulations adopted by the Obama administration, the 2015 rule called “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing.” The regulation requires communities receiving federal grants totake significant actions to overcome historic patterns of segregation, achieve truly balanced and integrated living patterns, promote fair housing choice, and foster inclusive communities that are free from discrimination.On Jan. 2, however, Carson announced that enforcement of the regulation would be postponed at least until October 2020.And just last month, HuffPost revealed the existence of an internal HUD memo making it clear that Carson intended to change the agency mission statement, eliminating language calling for the building of “inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination.”The new statement would read:HUD’s mission is to ensure Americans have access to fair, affordable housing and opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency, thereby strengthening our communities and nation.On March 28, my colleague Glenn Thrush wrote that the change in the mission statement was part of a broad effortto scale back federal efforts to enforce fair housing laws, freezing enforcement actions against local governments and businesses, including Facebook, while sidelining officials who have aggressively pursued civil rights cases.Thrush noted that in November, Anna Maria Farías, assistant HUD secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity, ordered a halt to “about a half-dozen fair housing investigations” that had been given top priority during the Obama administration.The support Trump has garnered — and continues to maintain — among broad swaths of voters indicates the power and depth of the resentment and animosity in a segment of the American electorate that, before his candidacy, few analysts were fully aware of. Trump’s core supporters — Americans most resistant to the racial and ethnic changes taking place around them — have not been subsumed by a dominant liberal culture, as many had hoped.In a February paper, “The Racial and Economic Context of Trump Support,” Eric Knowles, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U., and Linda Tropp, a professor of social psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, found thatneighborhood-level exposure to racial and ethnic minorities predicts greater group threat and racial identification among Whites as well as greater intentions to vote for Trump in the general election.In February, AP/NORC conducted a survey that asked “Do you think Donald Trump is a racist or is not a racist?” Of the 1,337 adults questioned, 57 percent said that he was a racist, and 40 percent said he was not. The same percentage said Trump’s policies “have been bad” for Muslims; 56 percent said that they have hurt Hispanics; and 47 percent said African-Americans were on the losing end.The results raise an interesting question: Will these numbers help or hurt Trump’s re-election effort?I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael D. Shear and Nicholas FandosWASHINGTON — For days, top Republicans in Congress demanded the release of James B. Comey’s memos about President Trump, threatening Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, with a subpoena if he failed to share the highly anticipated documents written by the former F.B.I. director.But if Mr. Trump and his allies believed that Mr. Rosenstein’s refusal would deliver a pretext to call for his firing, as Democrats asserted, his decision to quickly release all the memos late Thursday night foiled that plan. The memos leaked to reporters hours after being delivered to lawmakers in both parties.And the seven memos, in which Mr. Comey methodically documented his interactions with the president in real time, did little to help Republicans undermine Mr. Comey’s credibility or expose contradictions with his best-selling, tell-all book. Taken together, the 15 pages of detailed notes largely back up the stories that Mr. Comey told in congressional testimony, in the pages of his memoir, “A Higher Loyalty,” and during numerous television and radio interviews.“I’m not quite sure how this improved the strategic posture of those who want to dismantle the special counsel investigation,” said Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland. “This is a tactic that has backfired. From what I’ve seen of the Comey memos, they bear out completely the authenticity of his reports and his own credibility.”Word last spring that Mr. Comey had taken contemporaneous notes of his meetings with Mr. Trump jolted Washington, and for nearly a year, the existence of the still-secret memos cast a shadow over the capital, generating intense speculation about the private details that might be exposed if they were made public. Salacious talk of Russian prostitutes, a request to ease up on the investigation of the president’s national security adviser and a presidential demand for the loyalty of the F.B.I. director all made for bombshell revelations.But by the time the actual memos appeared, the details were already known, and some Republicans suggested the real import of the memos was that they indicated that there was no obstruction of justice case.“I don’t know that it was necessarily earth-shattering, the new information that we found,” said Representative Mark Meadows, a conservative Republican of North Carolina. “But if someone is trying to suggest an obstruction of justice case, I would use the memos as one of the exhibits to use in the defense. It didn’t sound like Director Comey was intimidated.”Members of both parties said Friday that Mr. Comey’s notes mostly repeat his public testimony and are unlikely to drastically change the trajectory of Mr. Trump’s presidency or alter the investigations swirling around him.The release of the memos showed that Mr. Comey’s recent public statements have barely strayed from the recollections that he put on paper during the months before he was fired by Mr. Trump last May. The memos document how the president sought loyalty from Mr. Comey; asked him to “let go” of the investigation into Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser; and pressed Mr. Comey to publicly clear him in the Russia inquiry.In addition, the memos provide more evidence of what Mr. Comey saw as the president’s obsession with the allegations of indecent behavior. Mr. Comey wrote in the memos — as he did in his book — that Mr. Trump repeatedly brought up a supposed encounter with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room in 2013.Democrats said the memos helped establish that Mr. Comey was not a disgruntled employee who made up stories about the president.“Thanks @HouseGOP for urging release of the Comey memos!” Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, gleefully wrote on Twitter.Some Republicans continued to assail Mr. Comey, casting doubt on his judgment and suggesting that he had been motivated by resentment over his firing.In a statement about the memos, the three Republican committee chairmen who had pressed for their release wrote that Mr. Comey never explicitly said in his memos that the president was trying to interfere in the Russia investigation.“While former Director Comey went to great lengths to set dining room scenes, discuss height requirements, describe the multiple times he felt complimented, and myriad other extraneous facts, he never once mentioned the most relevant fact of all, which was whether he felt obstructed in his investigation,” they wrote.Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet that the memos “show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION.”Some of the president’s most ardent Republican supporters acknowledged that the previously unreported details in the memos were not likely to emerge as important evidence to counter the narrative that Mr. Comey is offering publicly during his weekslong book tour.Mr. Meadows and other Republican lawmakers seized on the memos, which were lightly redacted by the Justice Department before they were released, as proof that Mr. Comey had leaked classified information when he gave copies of some to a friend, with permission to read them to a reporter from The New York Times.The Justice Department’s inspector general is conducting a review of the handling of classified information contained in Mr. Comey’s memos, according to a person briefed on the investigation. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is expected to dedicate a section of a larger report about the F.B.I.’s decision-making in 2016 to the matter of Mr. Comey’s documents.Mr. Comey gave copies of at least two of his memos to Daniel C. Richman, a longtime associate outside the F.B.I. Some of the memos were later deemed to contain classified information. In one case, Mr. Comey had personally redacted such information before handing it to Mr. Richman, and in another, the F.B.I. deemed the material classified only after it was in Mr. Richman’s possession.Mr. Comey has said he shared the memos with Mr. Richman under the assumption that they would be shared with the news media and to put pressure on the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to oversee the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation. The inspector general has questioned witnesses about the matter, and F.B.I. agents conducted a search of Mr. Richman’s New York office to ensure that the leak was contained.The inspector general’s review was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.“This is a stain on James Comey’s judgment when it comes to law enforcement matters,” Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said Friday afternoon on CNN. He said Mr. Comey’s decision to leak the memos to his friend “raises serious questions about his judgment and his integrity.”The president himself continued his criticism late Friday night, writing on Twitter, “James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council?”Democrats said on Friday that Republicans had failed in their efforts to discredit Mr. Comey’s assertions about the president’s private behavior. They predicted that the memos would help investigators piece together a case against Mr. Trump and his associates.“The simple fact is they unquestionably show pressure by the president to stymie or stop the investigation, and so they are more evidence of attempts to obstruct justice,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.Mr. Blumenthal accused Republicans of trying — with little success — to twist the meaning of the memos.“They are pretty much raw history, which people can spin to serve their partisan purposes,” he said.Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican of Pennsylvania who has criticized efforts to undermine the Russia investigation, said both sides were misguided if they thought the release of the full memos would affect the fundamentals of the case.“There might be some salacious details here,” Mr. Dent said, “but nothing is changing the overall narrative on the Mueller investigation.”Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.videoAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
politics,"AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBy James B. StewartThroughout his presidential campaign Donald J. Trump extolled his business acumen and management skills, and just before his inauguration he insisted the transition to his administration was going “very, very smoothly.”Yet so chaotic was his first year in office that in January, after publication of the Michael Wolff tell-all, “Fire and Fury,” the president had to publicly defend himself as a “stable genius.”The White House suffered a staff turnover rate of 34 percent during Mr. Trump’s first year, a rate that would be unfathomable at nearly any for-profit enterprise. Even by political standards, it’s off the charts — triple that of the Obama administration, and twice that of Ronald Reagan, the previous record-holder — according to a study by the Brookings Institution.And that was before the recent messy departure of Rob Porter as staff secretary in the wake of spousal abuse allegations, or the announcement on Wednesday by the White House communications director Hope Hicks — the fourth person to hold the job — that she, too, was leaving.Now at least one White House faction wants Gary Cohn, the chief economic adviser and National Economic Council director — and a relative island of calm and stability — to replace John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, who was widely criticized for bungling the Porter affair. If so, he would become the president’s third chief of staff in just 14 months. But in this chaotic environment, for every rumor that Mr. Cohn is about to be promoted, there is one that he is about to resign.With over a full year under Mr. Trump’s belt, and his unorthodox management style fully in evidence, I asked several experts to assess the president’s abilities as a manager.“It’s much worse than I expected,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University and the author of “Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don’t.”“The most important thing you need as a chief executive is the ability to hire and retain talent,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Trump said he’d get all these great people to work for him. But the rate of departures is unprecedented. Either he hired badly, or he hired well but couldn’t retain them. Either way, this reflects badly on his leadership.”As Jeffrey T. Polzer, professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School, told me last year, the time-tested approach is “to surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise, who bring different perspectives to the issue at hand.”“Then you foster debate and invite different points of view in order to reach a high-quality solution,” Mr. Polzer said.He added that it “requires an openness to being challenged, and some self-awareness and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do.”Mr. Trump does appear to solicit and consider the opinions of others, but they are as likely to be random guests at Mar-a-Lago, or television pundits, as they are experts in the field, or even his own appointees.“The lack of attention to data drives me nuts,” Mr. Pfeffer said. Mr. Trump, he said, “seems to have no interest in science, social science or data,” citing White House initiatives to repeal Obamacare and to rescue the coal industry as glaring examples.Others pointed to his threats to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with little understanding of the consequences for American businesses and farmers, and his decision to abandon the Paris climate accord despite scant familiarity with the science of climate change.“Nothing about the chaos and turnover in the White House surprises me,” said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.“He hasn’t changed in 30 years,” Mr. Elson added. “He isn’t bound by any traditional norms of management.”Yet despite the well-documented disarray prevailing in the West Wing, Mr. Trump’s first year has yielded some major accomplishments: business-friendly tax legislation, the appointment of a reliably conservative Supreme Court justice in Neil Gorsuch, the selection of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the dismantling of a regulatory regime viewed as overly burdensome by the business community.“You have to hand it to him: He has pulled some rabbits out of his hat,” Mr. Elson said. “Hardly anyone thought he could pull off tax legislation after so many other people had tried and failed.”But Mr. Pfeffer said those achievements had occurred despite the chaos, not because of it. For every success, Mr. Trump has had notable failures, starting with overhauling immigration policy and repealing Obamacare.“I’ve long felt that if Trump didn’t do well, it would be because of organizational issues,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Even with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, he hasn’t been able to pass much. That speaks to chaos in the policy sphere.”Mr. Elson said Mr. Trump acted more like the typical entrepreneur than an experienced manager. “A problem with entrepreneurs is that people get tired of it and they move on,” he said. “People just get worn out. At some point you need a real manager. A lot of entrepreneurs sell their businesses when they reach a certain size and they realize they can’t manage them.”Would naming Mr. Cohn as chief of staff ameliorate the problem? Despite disenchantment with Mr. Kelly and his handling of the Porter situation, no one I interviewed thinks Mr. Cohn could fundamentally change the dynamic in the Trump White House any more than Mr. Kelly has.Mr. Cohn is now basking in the afterglow of the tax legislation, which seems to be growing in popularity with the public. His supporters point to the first-rate team he assembled at the National Economic Council as evidence that he — perhaps alone among top White House officials — could attract and retain talent. He enjoys good relations with Congress.But if Mr. Cohn became Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, he would have to sublimate his own beliefs to the president’s agenda. As one former White House official told me, “He can’t pull another Charlottesville,” referring to Mr. Cohn’s efforts last summer to publicly distance himself from the president’s racially charged comments while still working for him.Thanks to that incident, Mr. Cohn has already fallen from favor once, and his current rehabilitation may not last. People like Mr. Trump “have friends for a day,” Mr. Elson said. “That’s another quality of the entrepreneur. Like it or not, it’s part of what makes them successful.”While Mr. Cohn has influential supporters at the White House, talk of his possible elevation has prompted plenty of opposition, too, especially from representatives of Mr. Trump’s populist base. Mr. Cohn is, after all, a longtime Manhattan Democrat.A White House spokesman declined to comment on behalf of Mr. Cohn.In any event, Mr. Trump may be oblivious to the staff turnover and widespread vacancies in the executive branch, and indifferent to calls to replace Mr. Kelly.“I don’t think Trump thinks much about management philosophy,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “He ran for president as a lark, and look at him now. For him it’s all upside.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.In the end, the wheelers and dealers faded away, trying to get what they could under cover of darkness. Their loss of stature was abrupt. Only those willing to soldier on as subordinates remained, ceding authority to their leader, President Trump.For four decades, from 1968 to 2008, what was loosely described as the Republican establishment — the party’s congressional leaders, campaign operatives, donors, lobbyists and special interests — reigned supreme.Every four years, the party’s presidential nominee secured the establishment’s stamp of approval. Endorsements from governors and senators — and a gigantic campaign chest fed by major Republican fund-raisers — were the main markers of that approval.In a party deeply committed to hierarchy, the establishment-favored candidate was always the next in line, often the vice president (George H.W. Bush in 1988) or the candidate who had come in second (or a very close third) in the previous contested nomination battle (Ronald Reagan 1980, Bob Dole 1996, John McCain 2008 and Mitt Romney 2012).Now, the Republican establishment, embodied in the Bush family, proud but powerless, is a relic of a past, brought to its knees by insurgent forces, not least of which is the ascendance of social media.[Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]“The Republican Party today is very much an outsiders’ party,” Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary for the last anointed president, George W. Bush, said in an interview. “The mood of the party is ‘pound the table’ and say ‘everybody who has been on the inside is part of the problem’. ”John Feehery, a lobbyist who served as a top aide to the Republican House leadership, argued in an email that the collapse of the establishment began during the administration of George W. Bush:The establishment destroyed itself by blundering into the Iraq war and by not preventing the financial crisis of 2007. Those were the precipitating events that gave rise to the Tea Party which ultimately transformed into the Trump movement.“At a more granular level,” Feehery continued,the so-called influencers distanced themselves from the actual voters, retreating into a bubble and pontificating from their gated communities. This gave rise to the popularity of the conservative media movement, which became the go-to news source. The news from these sources didn’t have to be fully accurate as long as it seemed right.It cannot be emphasized enough how central the rise of information age right-wing media has been to the shifting balance of power within the Republican Party. In “Placing Media in Conservative Culture,” Matt Grossmann and David Hopkins, political scientists at Michigan State and Boston College, write that the growing strength of the ideological media “represents a mixed blessing from the perspective of Republican politicians and traditional conservative elites.”On the plus side, they write,Fox News, talk radio, and right-wing internet sites allow Republicans to communicate with their party’s popular base and help to mobilize conservative activists and voters against the Democratic opposition.On the negative side,the distinctive popular conservative culture that these media outlets both reinforce and promote is also fertile ground for repeated challenges to the party’s existing leadership by self-styled political outsiders — including, most notably, Donald Trump.The direct threat posed by conservative broadcast and digital media to the Republican establishment, according to Grossmann and Hopkins, is that figures like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity gain leverage not only by attacking the left, but “by accusing Republican politicians of ineffectiveness in opposing — if not outright complicity in — the enduring nemesis of liberalism.”Fox, Breitbart, Townhall, The Daily Caller and other right-wing media outlets now perform multiple functions traditionally associated with political parties: candidate screening, the maintenance of ideological conformity, reviewing policy positions and vetting congressional voting.The right-wing media was purposefully created by the conservative wing of the Republican Party, in part to help resolve a basic contradiction in the movement, according to Grossmann and Hopkins:Conservative candidates have also long grappled with the challenge of attracting electoral support for an ideological movement primarily dedicated to the perennially unpopular objective of limiting or rolling back major government programs and social benefits.Grossmann and Hopkins point out that a majority of American voters, when asked about specific policies, support federal spending. An April 2017 Pew Research Center survey, for example, found “that 61 percent of Republicans and 95 percent of Democrats would maintain or increase funding for health care” and that 61 percent of Republicans and 93 percent of Democrats “would maintain or increase spending for ‘economic assistance to needy people in the U.S.’ ”Crucial to the continued survival of the Republican Party, however, is the fact that when questions about taxes, spending and the role of government are put in generic, symbolic, abstract terms, without reference to specific policies, the majority of Americans take a conservative stance.How does this work? Substantially more voters identify themselves as conservative than as liberal, according to Gallup. Gallup also found that the public believes that the government wastes 51 cents of every dollar. In August 2017, Gallup reported that 52 percent of the public had an unfavorable view of the federal government and 29 percent had a favorable view.To counter potential defections to the Democratic Party, according to Grossmann and Hopkins, the right must focus on “conservatism as a brand name, or as a collection of general principles and values,” which is far more popular “than conservatism as a package of detailed policy positions.”Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, argued in an email that Trump and other Republican insurgents have been better at mobilizing their troops than the establishment wing of the party. The dissident wing, Lupia wrote, hasused social media to organize its myriad members more effectively. Some mass media outlets, and significant social media players, produce a steady stream of polarizing content that keeps members of the group hyper-vigilant towards real and imagined threats from globalists, foreigners, and the American left.Changes in campaign finance laws have acted in tandem with increasingly independent and influential conservative media outlets to undermine the Republican establishment. The most important of these changes came out of the 2010 Citizens United decision and related court rulings that opened the door to unlimited donations to super PACs, which effectively eliminated the near stranglehold vested Republican interests had on the flow of political money.This becomes glaringly apparent in a comparison of the pattern of fund-raising in 2008, the last election before the Citizens United decision, to the pattern in 2016. In the 2008 election, the three major Republican campaign committees raised a total of $657.6 million, six times the $111.9 million spent by nonparty conservative organizations.By 2016, however, the amount raised by the three Republican committees stagnated at $652.4 million, while the cash raised by conservative groups grew sevenfold to $810.4 million.In practical terms, the creation of a new and massive source of campaign support freed candidates to defy the establishment. This is just what the Tea Party did in 2010 and 2014.There is considerable disagreement over whether deregulated campaign finance and the mobilization of the angriest segment of the Republican electorate will inflict permanent damage on the Republican establishment.Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote me by email. “The establishment, such as it is, still exists, but its influence has been permanently weakened by changes in the media,” not just by conservative media, but by social media that “enables candidates to reach their respective bases in an inexpensive way. Endorsements and money mean less and less.”Ideological media outlets on both the left and right, Tanner argues “carry more weight than ever before,” displacing establishment influence over candidate selection, because both sides are now more dependent on mobilizing base voters than in persuading the ever-smaller faction of uncommitted voters.A colleague of Tanner’s, Emily Ekins, director of polling at Cato, argued in an email thatIt’s useful to not think of the G.O.P. establishment as a cohesive bloc but rather as a coalition that has been fracturing long before Trump arrived. We saw this with the rise of the tea party, the push to oust former Speaker John Boehner, the House Freedom Caucus, the inability of House Republicans to agree on health care reform, etc. Without cohesion it’s hard for it to control the process.Ekins points out that Trump’s successful defiance of the establishment in winning the nomination has not resulted in the abandonment of policies favored by the traditional power brokers.“When it comes to policymaking, traditional establishment priorities appear to maintain influence over agenda setting,” she wrote:Although reforming the tax system and repealing the ACA (Obamacare) are traditional Republican priorities, these were ranked far lower, below a border wall, among Trump’s core set of supporters. So while the establishment may be hanging back such that they avoid conflicts with Trump, they are still engaged in the policymaking process.Expanding on this theme in “Intraparty Democracy and the 2016 Election,” Julia Azari  and Seth Masket, political scientists at Marquette and the University of Denver, argue that the breakdown of establishment forces has endangered the workings of the political system. Democratization, in other words, has undermined democracy:It is not without irony that the most recent presidential election produced a result that so violated a great many substantive ideas about democracy. From his campaign promises to jail his opponent to his pre-election lamentations that the general electoral contests were rigged to his vows to strip citizens of their rights for expressing unpopular political views, Donald Trump proved to be one of the most hostile presidential candidates toward basic democratic norms in the modern age.How “did such democratic parties produce such an anti-democratic result?” Azari and Masket ask. Their answer:The parties’ moves toward internal party democracy, we maintain, helped create an environment in which a candidate like Trump could succeed. We believe that several aspects of party democratization are responsible for the inability of the Republican Party to thwart Trump’s candidacy.Put another way, the demotion of Republican power brokers opened the door to the Trump presidency.In a separate essay, “Weak parties and strong partisanship are a bad combination,” Azari wrote:Voters do not have to listen to elite signals. Elites do not have to listen to each other’s signals. Parties have been stripped (in part by their own actions) of their ability to coordinate and bargain.Not only have party establishments lost their ability to coordinate and bargain, but Trump has successfully pushed the Republican Party elite into a corner. As Masket wrote in an email,Trump has access to a group of voters that they’ve been courting for decades — working class whites. They’re eager to claim the support of this demographic and, more importantly, terrified to offend it by turning on Trump.The Trump insurgency, in this context, amounted to an internal realignment or revolution within the Republican Party. What is now the party’s largest bloc of voters — whites without college degrees — wrested power from the establishment.Data provided to The Times by Scott Keeter, a senior survey adviser at Pew Research Center, shows that these non-college white voters cast a solid majority — 62.7 percent — of all the votes Trump received in the 2016 election.A forthcoming study of Trump’s campaign speeches by three sociologists at Harvard — Michèle Lamont, Bo Yun Park and Elena Ayala-Hurtado — found that Trump purposely capitalized “on and appealed to workers’ desire to assert what they believe is their rightful place in the national pecking order,” including their premier status within the Republican Party.Henry Olsen, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, explained it this way in a January 2018 essay “Hearing the People” in National Review:Trump’s populism was simply the expression of one crucial but underrepresented element of the original conservative coalition, fighting back to achieve some measure of respect and equality.Sarah Treul, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, suggested in an email that by failing to take a firm stand against Trump in the early stages of the Republican primaries,the establishment may have lost its ability to be persuasive in future elections. The insurgence of inexperienced candidates will make it increasingly challenging for the establishment of either party to coordinate around one candidate even if it wants to.All this raises a larger question: Can the Republican Party continue to function over time without an elite establishment?Last week, in Politico, Alex Castellanos, the provocative Republican media consultant, made the intriguing argument that it is possible “to harness Trump’s base and add swing voters, even as we remain faithful to our principles.”As a first step, Castellanos calls for the renunciation of the traditional establishment, a group that converted the Reagan revolution from a movement into a business and then intoa self-preserving racket. In 2016, the American people judged that Washington Republicans had been poisoned by their success and become the very thing they were sent to the Capitol to change.In Castellanos’s view, the contemporary Republican Party must capitalize on Trump’s successes:He has crushed ISIS and increased our paychecks with a tax cut. He has erased regulations that were growing Washington’s economy at the expense of our economy. He has appointed a respected Supreme Court justice and transformed the judiciary to call balls and strikes.But the party must also steer clear of Trump’s failures:He left behind a vicious inflationary spiral. That, alongside devouring the country’s expectations for a president’s personal conduct, may be the greatest cost of his t. rex presidency.Permanently reorganizing the party around Trumpism will not be an easy task. Castellanos believes that Trump is likelyto be assessed as the bipolar leader he has become, both one of the worst and best presidents Americans have ever elected, perhaps the greatest president to be removed from the Oval Office in chains.Reflecting on the tumult, a Republican strategist who has been involved in campaigns at every level for more than 35 years and who is a dues-paying member of the establishment (and thus did not want his name used to avoid alienating his clients), expressed the contradictions of contemporary Republicanism with precision:The post-Trump world is a Humpty Dumpty story. No one is going to be able to put things back together again.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

politics,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The nation’s largest cities and metropolitan areas — home to a majority of Democratic voters — are at the forefront of the party’s most vexing racial, ethnic and class conflicts.Last week, in an essay for CityLab, Richard Florida, a professor of urban planning at the University of Toronto, described how housing costs are driving the growing division between upwardly and downwardly mobile populations within Democratic ranks:The rise in housing inequality brings us face to face with a central paradox of today’s increasingly urbanized form of capitalism. The clustering of talent, industry, investment, and other economic assets in small parts of cities and metropolitan areas is at once the main engine of economic growth and the biggest driver of inequality. The ability to buy and own housing, much more than income or any other source of wealth, is a significant factor in the growing divides between the economy’s winners and losers.Allies on Election Day, the two wings of the Democratic Party are growing further estranged in other aspects of their lives, driven apart by the movement of advantaged and disadvantaged populations within and between cities. These demographic patterns exacerbate intraparty tensions.Florida, writing with Benjamin Schneider of CityLab, expands on this point:While the advantaged members of the knowledge, professional, and creative class have enough money left over even after paying the cost of housing in these cities, it’s the less-well-paid members of the service and working classes who get the short end of the stick, with not nearly enough left over to afford the basic necessities of life. They are either pushed to the periphery of these places or pushed out altogether.The competition for housing between rich and poor has become a critically important and divisive issue in urban America.“The state of housing affordability in the expensive coastal metros is driving a wedge between two factions of the American left,” Issi Romem, a fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an email to me.In a paper published earlier this month, “Characteristics of Domestic Cross-Metropolitan Migrants,” Romem looked at the income and education levels of families moving in and out of 441 metropolitan areas. He found thatDomestic migration across U.S. metropolitan areas is selective: in-migrants to expensive metros tend to have higher incomes and educational attainment than out-migrants, while the opposite is true in the least expensive metros. This pattern contributes to the process of polarization across U.S. metros.One of the most expensive metropolitan areas in the country, San Francisco, is also one of the most Democratic sections of the country, (San Francisco County: Clinton 84.5 percent, Trump 9.2 percent). According to Romem, between 2005 and 2016, those moving into the San Francisco area had median household incomes averaging $12,639 a year more than the households of the families moving out, $70,015 to $57,376.Conversely, in the struggling Syracuse metropolitan area (Clinton 53.9 percent, Trump 40.1 percent), families moving in between 2005 and 2016 had median household incomes of $35,219 — $7,229 less than the median income of the families moving out of the region, $42,448.Research that focuses on the way city neighborhoods are changing by income, race and ethnicity, while not specifically addressed to political consequences, helps us see the potential for conflict within the Democratic coalition.Robert J. Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard, published a detailed study in 2015 for the St. Louis Federal Reserve of the economic composition of neighborhoods. Overall, he found, “middle-income neighborhoods are tenuous,” while neighborhoods at the top and bottom of the economic ladder have remained strikingly stable.For example, as Sampson explained by email,fully 80 percent of all U.S. neighborhoods in the top income quintile remained in place between 2000 and 2012. In Los Angeles, the persistence rate reached 87 percent among the highest income quintile neighborhoods. In Chicago 82 percent of the affluent neighborhoods in 2000 remained in place over the decade.Chicago, Sampson wrote, is “experiencing a concentrated affluence shift,” in whichthe black population has declined and Hispanics are now second largest after whites in population. The race/ethnic shift is something of a milestone given the history of the city.Despite this shift, Chicago remains reliably Democratic. In 2016, Clinton beat Trump there 83.7 percent to 12.5 percent.In firmly Democratic neighborhoods across the country, the economic status of those moving in and out began to shift radically starting at the beginning of this century.Take, for example, “Accounting for Central Neighborhood Change, 1980-2010,” by Nathaniel Baum-Snow, an economist at the University of Toronto, and Daniel Hartley, an economist at the Federal Reserve in Chicago. They found that the core of the nation’s cities is being taken over by members of the affluent wing of the Democratic Party at the expense of the less affluent, disproportionately minority wing of the party:Central neighborhoods of most U.S. metropolitan areas experienced population decline 1980-2000 and population growth 2000-2010. 1980-2000 departures of residents without a college degree accounted for most of the decline while the return of college educated whites and the stabilization of neighborhood choices by less educated whites drove most of the post-2000 rebound.Baum-Snow and Hartley cite what they call “a shifting balance between departures of low SES (socioeconomic status) minorities and inflows of high SES whites” and point out that neighborhoods surrounding cities’ central business districts have experienced a turnarounddriven by the return of college-graduate and high-income whites to these neighborhoods, coupled with a halt in the outflows of other white demographic groups. At the same time, the departures of minorities without college degrees continued unabated.In Chicago, Baum-Snow and Hartley point out, the largely minority census tracts that gained whites the fastest from 1980 to 2010 were “almost exclusively within 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) of the central business district.”A similar pattern has emerged in the urban West. “Gentrification in the Bay Area, Portland and Seattle,” Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, told me in an email, “is definitely pushing disadvantaged populations out of old neighborhoods and into far-flung exurbs.”Within major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Cain continued,the sorting is also between neighborhoods, with large nonwhite populations surrounded by white/Asian suburbs, and certain Latinos and Asians displacing blacks.Upscale liberal whites “who consider themselves committed to racial justice” tend to be “NIMBYists when it comes to their neighborhoods,” Cain wrote, “not living up to their affordable housing commitments and resisting apartment density around mass transportation stops.”“One of the key problems of the information/digital economy,” according to Cain,is that it thrives under conditions of amassing large concentrations of human and financial capital, which results in these homogeneous bubbles. It doesn’t help that many of the tech workers are not as inclined to be good neighbors.The trends Cain cites are part of a nationwide shift.From the 1960s and 1970s to 2000, Florida pointed out by email, the basic pattern wasblacks were moving into and staying in cities, and whites were moving out. But in the period since 2000, and earlier than that for very successful cities like New York, San Francisco, Boston, Washington D.C., and Seattle, affluent white highly educated people begin to move in, and less educated whites and particularly less educated and less affluent blacks begin moving out.As intraparty economic and racial divisions have increased within the Democratic coalition, the political power of the well-to-do has grown at the expense of racial and ethnic minorities.Right now, a heated conflict has erupted within Democratic ranks in California over pending legislation (SB 827) that would override local zoning laws to allow developers to exceed height and density limits in return for an agreement to include more affordable housing units near transit hubs.In very liberal Marin County (Clinton 77.3 percent, Trump 15.5 percent, median household income $100,310), elected officials of at least seven local municipalities have voted to oppose the legislation.Jonathan Chait, writing in New York Magazine on Wednesday, pointed out that the housing issue in California and elsewhere,is ultimately a question of whether the most prosperous parts of blue America can be opened up to new entrants, or whether they will remain closed off and increasingly unaffordable. It is also a political test for whether progressives will be manipulated by knee-jerk suspicions, or be able to think clearly about using the market to serve human needs.After overwhelmingly Democratic City Councils along the California coast voted to oppose the legislation, the Democratic State Senate answered Chait’s question and killed the bill.The maneuvers in California are a reflection of a larger problem for Democrats: their inability to reconcile the conflicts inherent in the party’s economic and racial bifurcation.Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard, addressed the Democrats’ dilemma in a recent essay for Project Syndicate:In principle, greater inequality produces a demand for more redistribution. Democratic politicians should respond by imposing higher taxes on the wealthy and spending the proceeds on the less well off.In practice, Rodrik writesdemocracies have moved in the opposite direction. The progressivity of income taxes has decreased, reliance on regressive consumption taxes has increased, and the taxation of capital has followed a global race to the bottom. Instead of boosting infrastructure investment, governments have pursued austerity policies that are particularly harmful to low-skill workers. Big banks and corporations have been bailed out, but households have not. In the United States, the minimum wage has not been adjusted sufficiently, allowing it to erode in real terms.Why?Rodrik cites the work of the French economist Thomas Piketty, who argues that political parties on the left have been taken over, here and in Europe, “by the well-educated elite” — what Piketty calls the “Brahmin Left.” The Brahmin Left, writes Rodrik,is not friendly to redistribution, because it believes in meritocracy — a world in which effort gets rewarded and low incomes are more likely to be the result of insufficient effort than poor luck.Michael Lind, a professor of public policy at the University of Texas in Austin, wrote in a prescient 2014 essay, “The Coming Realignment: Cities, Class, and Ideology After Social Conservatism,” that “high-density downtowns and suburban villages are coming to have an hourglass-shaped social structure.”“Wealthy individuals” are at the top, according to Lind, with a “large luxury-service proletariat at the bottom.” Democrats, in this scheme, have become the party ofthe downtown and edge city elites and their supporting staff of disproportionately foreign-born, low-wage service workers.Lind’s point raises a fundamental question for the Democratic Party: Can it find a way to hold its “hourglass-shaped” political coalition together?Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, predicted the potential political developments of this situation in an article in March 2016:Over the next decade or so, the Republicans will split between their growing nationalist-populist wing and their business establishment wing, a split that the nationalist-populist wing will eventually win. The Democrats will face a similar split between the increasingly pro-corporate but socially liberal Clinton wing and a more economically progressive Sanders wing, a split that the Clinton wing will eventually win.The outcome?The Democrats will become the party of urban cosmopolitan business liberalism, and the Republicans will become the party of suburban and rural nationalist populism.Clearly, the 2016 election demonstrated the fragility of the Democratic coalition and its vulnerability to challenge from the populist right.Dani Rodrik picks up this point in his Project Syndicate essay:Why were democratic political systems not responsive early enough to the grievances that autocratic populists have successfully exploited — inequality and economic anxiety, decline of perceived social status, the chasm between elites and ordinary citizens? Had political parties, particularly of the center left, pursued a bolder agenda, perhaps the rise of right-wing, nativist political movements might have been averted.The forces behind the conversion of the Democratic Party into “the party of urban cosmopolitan business liberalism,” as described by Drutman, may be inexorable. If so, Rodrik’s call on the center-left to adopt a “bolder agenda” may be beyond reach.Taking it a step further, a Democratic Party based on urban cosmopolitan business liberalism runs the risk not only of leading to the continued marginalization of the minority poor, but also — as the policies of the Trump administration demonstrate — to the continued neglect of the white working-class electorate that put Trump in the White House.In other words, Democratic strategists looking to piece together a 21st century political alliance have to consider the unintended consequences of taking the easy route: constructing a coalition explicitly dominated by elites.I say easy because — compared to the average resident of the United States — the affluent are “vastly more engaged politically,” as Douglas S. Massey and Jacob S. Rugh, sociologists at Princeton and Brigham Young University, write in a forthcoming paper, “Isolation at the Extremes”:Whereas 99 percent of the wealthy voted in the 2012 presidential election and 60 percent gave money to a political candidate, the corresponding figures were just 78 percent and 18 percent for Americans in general. As a result, the affluent are far more likely to have their political preferences reflected in public policies than other Americans.The force that had historically pushed policy to the economic left — organized labor — has for the most part been marginalized. African-American and Hispanic voters have shown little willingness to join Democratic reform movements led by upper middle class whites, as shown in their lack of enthusiasm for Bill Bradley running against Al Gore in 2000 or Sanders running against Clinton in 2016.The hurdle facing those seeking to democratize elite domination of the Democratic Party is finding voters and donors who have a sustained interest in redistributive policies — and the minimum wage is only a small piece of this. Achieving that goal requires an economically coherent center-left political coalition. It also requires the ability to overcome the seemingly insuperable political divisions between the white working class and the African-American and Hispanic working classes — that elusive but essential multiracial — and now multiethnic — majority. Establishing that majority in a coherent political coalition is the only way in which the economic interests of those in the bottom half of the income distribution will be effectively addressed.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Sopan DebWhen Camille Cosby, the wife of Bill Cosby, issued a scathing statement on Thursday denouncing the verdict that found her husband guilty of sexual assault, she painted him as a casualty of an unfair, racist system. She blamed the media, the prosecution and the victim, and then made a comparison to one of the nation’s most infamous crimes.“Since when are all accusers truthful?” Mrs. Cosby said. “History disproves that. For example, Emmett Till’s accuser immediately comes to mind.”It was the second time in a week that a member of Bill Cosby’s inner circle linked him to Till, and while the comment drew immediate backlash, it was merely the most recent invocation of Till’s name as analogue.Beyond its impact on the civil rights movement, Till’s memory has inspired protesters, historians and documentarians to the present day; endured in popular culture as a synonym for injustice; and occasionally rekindled anger when used in unexpected ways.Airickca Gordon-Taylor, a cousin of Till, said in a phone interview on Thursday that Mrs. Cosby’s comments were in “poor taste.”“You’ve got apples and you have oranges and there’s nothing about either situation that is in alignment with the other,” said Ms. Gordon-Taylor, the head of the Mamie Till Mobley Memorial Foundation, named after Till’s mother.In 1955, Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago, was visiting relatives in Jim Crow-era Mississippi when, witnesses said, he whistled at a white woman named Carolyn Bryant Donham. It was never clear whether Till actually whistled, but the truth mattered little: Four days later, he was kidnapped from his great-uncle’s home, beaten, tortured and shot. His body was then dumped in the Tallahatchie River.Two men were arrested — Roy Bryant, Ms. Donham’s husband, and his half brother, J.W. Milam — but they were acquitted of murder by an all-white jury. Later, both men admitted to the crime in an interview with Look Magazine, but could not be retried because of the law’s double-jeopardy protections.Till’s mother wanted an open coffin at his funeral so people could see what had happened to her boy, and a photograph of her agony became a catalyst for the civil rights movement.Till’s story received renewed attention in the 1980s, in part because of a documentary that aired on a Chicago television station, “The Murder and the Movement.” In the years since, Till has been the subject of several books, including one by his mother, and more documentaries. In 2004, the F.B.I. reopened the investigation into Till’s case to explore whether anyone could be charged. No one was.Last year Timothy B. Tyson, a Duke University professor and author of the 2017 book “The Blood of Emmett Till,” revealed that Ms. Donham had told him that one account she had given in front of the judge in her husband’s case — that Till had grabbed her and was menacing — was false. Some commenters on Twitter have suggested that if Mr. Cosby could be prosecuted for a sexual assault that occurred more than a decade ago, Ms. Donham should face prosecution as well.In recent years, Till’s name has frequently been used in discussions of unarmed black men and boys shot dead by police or, in the case of Trayvon Martin, by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, who ultimately was acquitted.“It’s not just a conceptual overlap between Trayvon, Black Lives Matter and Emmett Till, but a very personal overlap,” said Dave Tell, a professor at the University of Kansas who has studied Till extensively. “The Till family is very close to the family of Trayvon Martin. They see Emmett Till as the protohistory of the Black Lives Matter movement.”He added: “We’re at a moment right now where more are talking about Emmett Till than has been the case in 60-plus years.”Some prominent writers have sought to tamp down the Martin and Till comparisons. Eugene Robinson, a columnist for The Washington Post, wrote in 2012: “To make a facile comparison is a disservice to history — and to the memory of both young men. It is ridiculous to imply that nothing has changed.”Eric Holder, who was attorney general when a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., fatally shot Michael Brown in 2014, compared Mr. Brown’s death to Till’s at an event in Washington where a tree was planted in Till’s memory.“There is an enduring legacy that Emmett Till has left with us that we still have to confront as a nation,” Mr. Holder said.Every corner of pop culture has lamented the Till tragedy, from Bob Dylan, who sang “The Death of Emmett Till” in 1962, to the rapper Rick Ross, who referenced Till on his 2010 track, “Tears Of Joy.” The comedian Dave Chappelle compared Till’s death to President Trump’s election as potential catalysts for change in his recent Netflix special, “Equanimity.” A short film about Till’s case, “My Nephew Emmett,” told from the perspective of the great-uncle whose home Till was taken from, was nominated for an Oscar this year.When the N.B.A. star LeBron James had a racial slur painted on the front of his home in Los Angeles last year, he talked about Till.“I think back to Emmett Till’s mom actually, and the reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America,” Mr. James said.The image of Till’s coffin has become its own reference point transcending race. When the mother of Noah Pozner, one of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, laid him to rest in an open coffin with a cloth covering the place his jawline should have been,  she said, “I just want people to know the ugliness of it so we don’t talk about it abstractly, like these little angels just went to heaven.” Gun control supporters made the comparison to Till’s mother.But some invocations, like Mrs. Cosby’s, have been questionable. In 2013, the rapper Lil Wayne used Till’s name as a metaphor in a vulgar sexual lyric, lost a Pepsi endorsement and subsequently apologized to Till’s family. In his debut single in 2004, “Through The Wire,” Kanye West compared his own face after a car accident to that of Till in his coffin, and Till remained in Mr. West’s lexicon in 2010 when he compared the fallout after his infamous MTV Video Music Awards outburst against Taylor Swift to “a neo-Emmett Till.”And others have triggered criticism even when they intended to pay tribute: When a white artist, Dana Schutz, displayed her painting of Till’s open coffin at the Whitney Biennial last year, she was accused of cultural appropriation.“Emmett Till is just packed all in our heads,” said Clenora Hudson-Weems, a professor at the University of Missouri and the author of “Emmett Till: The Sacrificial Lamb of the Civil Rights Movement.” “We can’t get rid of it. It’s in our heads. It has indelibly impacted our American culture.”But for the Till family, his death is more than just a cultural landmark.“I just hope that when people speak about Emmett in certain contexts, they need to remember that there are people who are still alive in my family that suffered and survived that horrific incident,” his cousin, Ms. Gordon-Taylor, said. “They were in the house when that happened — I still have loved ones who relive that in their minds.”Follow Sopan Deb on Twitter:@SopanDeb.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles McDermid and Sandra Stevenson(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. President Trump had much praise for the groundbreaking summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea, and declared that in his own planned talks with the North he would not be fooled the way he said his predecessors had been.“The United States has been played beautifully, like a fiddle, because you had a different kind of a leader,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re not going to be played, O.K.?”Mr. Trump spoke after the Korean leaders agreed to work to remove all nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula and, within the year, pursue talks with the U.S. to declare an official end to the Korean War.Their meeting was long on theatrics, but was also marked by candid moments and sweeping pledges. Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, declared, “I came here to put an end to the history of confrontation.” Here’s a look at the meeting in the leaders’ own words._____2. President Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany disagreed openly about the future of the Iran nuclear deal and trade relations between the U.S. and Europe.Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel, who have had a chilly relationship, went out of their way to compliment each other — but it went only so far. Mr. Trump called the bilateral trade relationship “unfair,” and Ms. Merkel emerged from the White House without any notable progress on the nuclear deal with Iran or a permanent exemption for Germany from steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed in March.Both issues are time-sensitive: A temporary exemption from the tariffs for European countries expires on Tuesday, and Mr. Trump faces a May 12 deadline for recertifying the nuclear deal with Iran._____3. The House Intelligence Committee released its report on Russian election meddling, saying it had found no evidence that the Trump campaign was involved.Partisan bickering ensued: Republicans, who control the committee, criticized the Obama administration for a “slow and inconsistent” response to Russia’s active measures and took aim at the F.B.I. Democrats, in a dissenting document, accused the Republicans of prematurely closing the investigation to protect Mr. Trump. Read the full report here.And newly released emails suggest that Natalia Veselnitskaya, above, the Russian lawyer who met with Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower in June 2016, had closer ties to the Kremlin than she had let on._____4. Hundreds of Palestinian protesters stormed the Gaza security fence and tried to cross into Israel. Israeli troops responded with lethal force.As of Friday night, the Gaza health ministry said that three Palestinians had been killed, all of them shot in the head, and nearly 1,000 had been wounded, 178 of them by live ammunition.The protest was the fifth in a series of weekly demonstrations, billed as the Great Return March, meant to highlight the decade-old Israeli blockade and to rekindle international sympathy for Palestinian refugees’ claim of a right to return to what is now Israel.At least 40 demonstrators were killed in the first four weekly protests._____5. “Truth prevails.”That was Andrea Constand, whose sexual assault complaint against Bill Cosby led to his conviction, as she broke her long public silence with a Twitter message thanking the local community.Our critic at large Wesley Morris remembers a time when Mr. Cosby’s signature TV character — and America’s favorite father figure from the 1980s — once seemed inseparable from the man who portrayed him.“If a sexual predator wanted to come up with a smoke screen for his ghastly conquests,” he writes, “he couldn’t do better than Cliff Huxtable.”So, is Mr. Cosby going to prison? Here’s a look at what might come next._____6. More on the Golden State Killer: Using DNA from crime scenes, investigators plugged a genetic profile into an online genealogy database. They found distant relatives of the suspect, Joseph James DeAngelo, and traced their DNA to him.Mr. DeAngelo’s arrest came more than 30 years after the killer’s crime wave, confounding the belief that serial rapists and killers are incapable of stopping. Experts say that’s more myth than reality.And here’s some of the original news coverage of the Golden State Killer._____7. The U.S. economy, which has been whacked around like a pinball in the first quarter, still grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent, the government reported, offering a preliminary glance at the effects of the tax overhaul.The pace is below the 2.9 percent annualized rate recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, and short of President Trump’s goal of at least 3 percent. Most forecasters, however, expect quarterly growth to float around the 3 percent mark for the rest of the year.One economist called the 2.3 percent figure “moderately encouraging.”_____8. In Oman, in the Arabian Peninsula, certain rocks have a special ability: They can turn carbon dioxide into stone.Scientists say that if this natural process, called carbon mineralization, could be harnessed, accelerated and applied inexpensively on a huge scale — admittedly very big “ifs” — it could help fight climate change.In theory, the rocks could remove some of the billions of tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide that humans have pumped into the air since the beginning of the industrial age._____9. Report cards are in for yesterday’s first round of the N.F.L. Draft.According to the experts, there are players who will turn their teams into winners, and others who are already terrible busts. (Sometimes it’s the same player.) Read our own analysis of every pick in the first round here.Baker Mayfield, above, was the top pick, but the highest grade of the draft went to Derwin James, the safety selected by the Chargers at No. 17. With three A+’s, two A’s and just one B, his G.P.A. was a 3.98._____10. Finally, New Jersey is set to proclaim Danny DeVito Day.Starting this year, Nov. 17, the day the actor was born, will be reserved for Mr. DeVito. Gov. Philip Murphy is expected to issue a statewide proclamation in his honor.“I was very flattered,” Mr. DeVito said. “Of course, they first told me I could have a beach. Yeah, but they reneged. So I said: ‘Oh, that’s perfect. It’s New Jersey.’”Have a great weekend._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Miriam JordanRussian ballet dancers, Cuban baseball players and Chinese political dissidents. These are the kind of people fleeing persecution in their homelands who typically won asylum in the United States over the years.In many cases, they were in the country for a theatrical performance, a conference or a sports tournament, then sought refuge. Think Martina Navratilova, the Czech tennis player, who defected during the 1975 U.S. Open.Over the past five years, though, the number of asylum applications has skyrocketed. Civil wars in Africa, gang violence in Central America and government crackdowns in China have contributed to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases and processing times of up to six years. This presents a range of challenges to U.S. authorities, who are required under international law to give all of the cases careful consideration.This week, a caravan of 150 to 200 migrants, mainly from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, is waiting at the Mexican border in Tijuana to claim asylum, hoping to win permission to stay in the United States. But President Trump has urged his administration to redouble its efforts to enforce border laws, referring to the caravan over the weekend as “that mess,” and declaring, “We have the worst laws anywhere in the world, we don’t have borders.”Here’s a look at how we got here, and what America’s legal obligations are.The international agreement to protect asylum seekers emerged after the horrific events of World War II. The United Nations signed the refugee convention in 1951, which the United States ratified and incorporated into law in 1980.The goal is to provide a safe haven for those who can prove they are fleeing persecution in their homeland.There are two ways people can win protection and the right to live permanently in the United States. In both cases they must prove the same well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.People who apply and are selected overseas eventually enter the United States as refugees.Many of them, hundreds of thousands, remain parked in camps as the refugee application process unfolds, typically over several years. That process involves several interviews with United Nations and American officials. The United States also conducts several layers of security screening.People already on United States soil apply for asylum.Alexander Godunov, a principal dancer with the renowned Bolshoi Ballet, was granted asylum in the United States in 1979. He was the first of several dancers to defect from the Bolshoi during that year’s tour in the United States. He requested asylum in New York City and received it immediately. Ms. Navratilova received asylum in October 1975, a month after filing for it.During the 1980s, civil war in El Salvador displaced several hundred thousand people. Tens of thousands flocked to the United States and applied for political asylum.Nowadays, the process of applying for asylum often takes years to complete, from start to finish. It involves interviews with United States immigration officials and often with immigration judges.Whether people entered the country legally or not, they are eligible to apply for asylum.The world is suffering the worst refugee crisis since World War II. There are now a staggering number of refugees, asylum-seekers and displaced people — about 50 million.Violence around the globe is pushing desperate people to seek safety across international borders. People from the Middle East and Africa are taking rickety boats and making treacherous treks to reach Europe. They are less likely to show up at the southwest border of the United States than people from Latin America who are, relatively speaking, nearby and can come over land.In recent years, violence in Central America — it has some of the highest murder rates in the world — has prompted tens of thousands of people since 2014 to make the perilous journey to the United States.The migrants either turn themselves in at the border to American authorities or sneak into the country illegally. Regardless, they then declare that they are seeking asylum.Before 2011, only 1 percent of all arriving foreigners requested asylum. Today, one out of 10 apply, according to government officials.Jeff Sessions, the United States Attorney General, called the caravan now awaiting processing at the San Ysidro port of entry a “deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system.”“There is no right to demand entry without justification,” he said, adding that he would deploy prosecutors to handle cases.Indeed, there are signs that the administration is seeking to disqualify certain applicants, such as victims of domestic violence, who have sometimes won asylum. Recently, Mr. Sessions suggested they should not be eligible.Yet the law does require authorities to accept and consider their petitions.Once they are processed at the port of entry, they are likely to be transferred to a detention facility where they must pass the first step in the asylum process, a “credible-fear” interview with an officer of the United States Immigration and Citizenship Services.The number of credible-fear interviews conducted by the federal agency has soared from 5,000 in 2007 to 80,000 last year.More than three quarters of those interviewed pass that screening and are referred to an immigration judge for hearings that may span months or longer. (Those who fail the interview can be deported immediately.)Asylum applicants awaiting a hearing before a judge either remain in detention or are released wearing a tracking device, such as an ankle monitor, with a date to appear in court.Many Central Americans stay with friends and relatives who already live in the United States. Once 180 days have passed after filing of their application, they are eligible to work in the United States. Their children attend public schools.Because some migrants in the past have skipped their court hearings, Mr. Trump has criticized the practice of releasing migrants, describing it as “catch and release.” In recent months, his administration has ordered border officers to, when possible, keep these migrants in detention, rather than release them.“While these asylum seekers are, on paper, eligible for consideration for release on parole, in reality ICE holds them in detention for long periods of time,” said Eleanor Acer, director of refugee protection for Human Rights First.United States officials say the administration is trying to figure out how to deal with the surge in asylum applications in a manner that is consistent with its international obligations.Part of the problem is that immigration courts are clogged, and not just with asylum cases.At of the end of March, there were 692,298 cases in the backlog, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which tracks the trends. The average wait time for current pending cases was 718 days, or nearly two years.Central Americans who apply for asylum often have been threatened with death or suffered attacks at the hands of gangs. Often mothers flee to protect their children from recruitment.“We have seen firsthand the extraordinarily violent conditions in the Northern Triangle of Central America that forces families and children to flee their homes in search of urgently needed safety in the U.S.,” said Jennifer Sime, senior vice president of United States programs at the International Rescue Committee.“Those who qualify and are fleeing violence, who have no other route to protection, should be granted safety and asylum,” she said.Immigrant advocates say their circumstances are akin to those faced by people escaping war in Syria or Somalia. However, it is more difficult for Central Americans to win their cases.“A huge percentage of these people get deported,” said Marty Rosenbluth, an immigration attorney. “It’s a really difficult struggle to win asylum.”Mr. Rosenbluth said that all of his asylum cases based on gang violence have failed because his clients could not establish that they fit into a social group suffering particular persecution to qualify.In some cases, judges have found that applicants fabricated or exaggerated their claims, though that is not usually the case.Immigration court records show that more asylum cases were denied over the previous five years than have been granted. In fiscal year 2016, 62 percent of asylum cases were denied, compared with 44.5 percent five years earlier. Among Mexicans and Central Americans, the approval rate is substantially lower.Simply wanting a better life does not meet the international criteria to qualify for asylum. But there are people who apply anyway because it gives them some benefits, albeit temporarily, even if they ultimately lose their case.Since the election of Mr. Trump, undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for many years and fear deportation have been applying for asylum, knowing that they are unlikely to win, but hoping to remain in the country legally for a time.While their application crawls through the courts, they can obtain work permits and driver’s licenses.The administration, which has taken a hard-line on immigration, has said that it is seeking to expedite asylum cases and crack down on abuse.“There is a significant increase in terms of individuals seeking asylum,” said Jennifer Higgins, an associate director at United States Immigration and Citizenship Services who handles refugee and asylum issues. “Our goal is to make sure we have a fair and efficient asylum system. Right now we have individuals exploiting it. That means legitimate applicants will suffer.”The government has also said that it will prosecute those who break immigration law.In the case of the caravan, critics say that it would be a violation of international law to conduct speedy hearings for the caravan members at the expense of a full hearing of their claims.“The Trump administration has made clear that asylum seekers associated with the caravan will be subjected to detention, criminal prosecutions, and rushed proceedings, in essence punishing them for seeking refugee protection,” said Ms. Acer.But Ms. Higgins said officials are assigning staff and officers to help house and process all those admitted for hearings, wherever they end up.Alain Delaqueriere contributed research.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

MARCH 8, 2018

As she grappled with the rejection of editors and her husband, Plath spent her last months writing the poems that would secure her literary reputation.
Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men.

But his lynching changed history because of its effect on one of the nation’s most influential journalists, who was also the godmother of his first child: Ida B. Wells.“It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed,” Wells wrote in 1892 in the introduction to “Southern Horrors,” one of her seminal works about lynching, “Somebody must show that the Afro-American race is more sinned against than sinning, and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so.”c. 1875-1907A feminist poet and revolutionary who became a martyr known as China’s ‘Joan of Arc.’By AMY QIN MARCH 8, 2018With her passion for wine, swords and bomb making, Qiu Jin was unlike most women born in late 19th-century China. As a girl, she wrote poetry and studied Chinese martial heroines like Hua Mulan (yes, that Mulan) fantasizing about one day seeing her own name in the history books.But her ambitions ran up against China’s deeply rooted patriarchal society, which held that a woman’s place remained in the home. Undeterred, Qiu rose to become an early and fierce advocate for the liberation of Chinese women, defying prevailing Confucian gender and class norms by unbinding her feet, cross-dressing and leaving her young family to pursue an education abroad.1852-1886Established what may have been America’s first tennis court in the 1870s.By AMISHA PADNANI MARCH 8, 2018Mary Ewing Outerbridge didn’t have an easy time bringing tennis to America in 1874.First she had to get past customs agents.

Since she killed herself in 1971, her unblinking portraits have made her a seminal figure in modern-day photography and an influence on three generations of photographers, though she is perhaps just as famous for her unconventional lifestyle and her suicide.1945-1992A transgender pioneer and activist who was a fixture of Greenwich Village street life.By SEWELL CHAN MARCH 8, 2018Marsha P. Johnson was an activist, a prostitute, a drag performer and, for nearly three decades, a fixture of street life in Greenwich Village. She was a central figure in a gay liberation movement energized by the 1969 police raid on the Stonewall Inn. She was a model for Andy Warhol. She battled severe mental illness. She was usually destitute and, for much of her life, effectively homeless.When she died at 46, under murky circumstances, in summer 1992, Johnson was mourned by her many friends, but her death did not attract much notice in the mainstream press.1920-1951Cancer cells were taken from her body without permission. They led to a medical revolution.By ADEEL HASSAN MARCH 8, 2018She never traveled farther than Baltimore from her family home in southern Virginia, but her cells have traveled around the earth and far above it, too.She was buried in an unmarked grave, but the trillions of those cells — generated from a tiny patch taken from her body — are labeled in university labs and biotechnology companies across the world, where they continue to spawn and to play the critical role in a 67-year parade of medical advances.1933-1969A Bollywood legend whose tragic life mirrored Marilyn Monroe’s.By AISHA KHAN MARCH 8, 2018It was probably the first ghost story in Indian cinema. A bewildered young man in a mansion chasing glimpses of an ethereal, veiled beauty. The movie, “Mahal,” was a huge success, making the lead actress, Madhubala, who was barely 16, a superstar overnight.Nearly seven decades later, strains of the film’s signature song, “Aayega aane wala” (He will come), are instantly recognizable to most Indians, evoking the suspenseful tale of lost love and reincarnation.1843-1903Oversaw the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge after her engineer husband fell ill.By JESSICA BENNETT MARCH 8, 2018It was not customary for a woman to accompany a man to a construction site in the late 19th century. Petticoats tended to get in the way of physical work.But when Washington A. Roebling, the chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge, fell ill, it was his wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who stepped in — managing, liaising and politicking between city officials, workers, and her husband’s bedside to see the world’s first steel-wire suspension bridge to completion. She would become the first person to cross the bridge, too — carrying a rooster with her, as the story has it, for good luck.1891-1964A Harlem Renaissance-era writer whose heritage informed her modernist take on the topic of race.By BONNIE WERTHEIM MARCH 8, 2018When Nella Larsen died, in 1964, she left little behind: a ground-floor apartment, two published novels, some short stories, a few letters. She was childless, divorced and estranged from her half sister, who, in some accounts, upon learning she was to inherit $35,000 of Larsen’s savings, denied knowing the writer existed.It was a fitting end for a woman whose entire life had been a story of swift erasure.1815-1852A gifted mathematician who is now recognized as the first computer programmer.By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER MARCH 8, 2018A century before the dawn of the computer age, Ada Lovelace imagined the modern-day, general-purpose computer. It could be programmed to follow instructions, she wrote in 1843. It could not just calculate but also create, as it “weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.”The computer she was writing about, the British inventor Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, was never built. But her writings about computing have earned Lovelace — who died of uterine cancer in 1852 at 36 — recognition as the first computer programmer.1878-1955The first American woman to win an Olympic championship.By MARGALIT FOX MARCH 8, 2018The first American woman to win an Olympic championship died without ever knowing what she had achieved.That woman, Margaret Abbott, won the ladies’ golf competition, as the event was genteelly known, at the 1900 Games in Paris. She received a gilded porcelain bowl, a smattering of coverage in the newspapers and then nothing.How one editor’s personal thoughts on diversity led to Overlooked.

APRIL 26, 2018
Though the first games of squash were said to be played outdoors, against a wall of the Harrow School in England in the 1830s, today it is known as an inside sport.Two centuries after that open-air beginning, a public outdoor squash court has materialized in Manhattan. Several days after it opened, on a hazy 60-degree Sunday, a steady flow of enthusiasts wandered up to the curious structure, in the Lower East Side’s Hamilton Fish Park, grabbed rackets and stepped on the court. Danielle Brown, 37, a stylist, said she picked up the sport during her divorce and usually plays at an East Side Equinox. She was hitting with her boyfriend Justin Colon, 24, a tattoo artist who had never played squash. “It’s amazing being outside,” Ms. Brown said. “The sun hurts your eyes and I have a migraine, but the whole community has been dying for this. I like it better than playing inside.”Typically associated with elite colleges and private clubs, squash can be expensive and difficult to play in New York, with hefty court fees and a limited number of courts, as former courts are converted to more lucrative uses, like spin studios or locker rooms. The nonprofit behind the Hamilton Fish court, Public Squash, spent two years raising the $120,000 cost, made up of private donations and a crowdfunding campaign. (This reporter kicked in $60 in 2016.)The court is part of the Adopt-a-Park program, in which organizations, companies or artists launch temporary installations in public parks, said Crystal Howard, director of media relations for the Parks Department. Beginning in late March, a German company called ASB installed the court on top of a handball court (which has similar dimensions), working with a local contractor and architect. Built for all seasons, the court’s grippy foam floor allows rainwater to drain and minimizes slipping.AdvertisementStanding to the side of the court on its first weekend in action was Marvin Perelman, 79, a retired life-insurance salesman who lives in his childhood apartment on Avenue C. He wore a Brooklyn Dodgers cap and said he used to play in the 1970s at Columbia University. “I think it’s a fabulous sport for young people with no cardio problems,” he said. He thought the court would draw people new to the sport. “It’s not that different from handball or racquetball.”Benjamin Garrett, 44, a software developer and tournament squash player, was lending rackets, balls, and sneakers to those who needed them. He said he loved the court, but he thought a net would prevent the small, black squash balls from soaring over the back wall. He said the increased visibility might help popularize squash, which, for what it’s worth, is said to be the 12th-fastest-growing in the United States. “This is a sport with B-level popularity that should have A-level popularity, like tennis,” he said. “When someone says, ‘What’s squash?’ I just have this deep pain.”AdvertisementHamilton Fish Park, just down the street from the Samuel Gompers Houses public housing complex, was chosen because of its recreation center, which Ms. Howard said will have rackets and balls available for use, and its popular swimming pool, from which Public Squash hopes to draw the community. To that end, Public Squash and the City Parks Foundation are planning free Saturday squash clinics for local children beginning in mid-May.“We’re setting up these clinics to make sure it’s not just the Spence kids who come,” said Alex Wessner, a director at Public Squash, referring to the all-girls private school a few miles up the East River from Hamilton Fish. “We’re trying to get people from around here.”The court is open daily from 6 a.m. until the park closes, usually between 10 and 11 p.m., but there is no online reservation system, as there is for popular public tennis courts. Instead, “street rules” apply, also known as “I got next.” A rule on the door states, “Please limit play to one hour.” Ryan Wall, also of Public Squash, said the no-reservations system was chosen to make it as accessible as possible.“People who are forceful will enforce the time limit by speaking up,” said Mr. Garrett. “It’ll turn out the way basketball courts do — if there was one public basketball court in all of New York City.”On one of the basketball courts adjacent to the squash court, Amadou Sylla, 20, a student, had arrived with four nephews and a niece in tow. They tossed a basketball around for a few minutes before the children wandered over. “I thought it was for volleyball,” said Moussa Sylla, 7. “I saw them putting it up.”Mr. Wessner asked if anyone wanted to play; he soon had four takers, ages 2 to 11. He gave them rackets and had them swing at a racquetball ball, larger and easier to hit than the lychee-sized squash ball. The most enthusiastic player was Magata Doucoure, 3, who shouted, “I did it! I did it!” when she connected. After the kids left the court and Mr. Wessner asked for the rackets back, Miss Doucoure said sadly, “I have to play later.” Abdoulaye Sylla, 2, wept as he rejoined his uncle on the basketball court.AdvertisementA young man approached with a smartphone, took in the court, and said: “It’s beautiful! This is sick!” He turned out to be Nima Olumi, 23, a digital marketing executive who volunteered at SquashBusters in Boston, a youth development program, and later played at Bates College. He had come to the park to play basketball with his cousins and check out the court. “This doesn’t solve squash’s elitism problem,” he said, “but it definitely helps. It gives access. It’s like a public golf course.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The sight of a shirtless squash player on an outdoor court, a stone’s throw from the East River, seemed to encapsulate New York’s past and future at once.Mr. Wessner of Public Squash said that in recent weeks he has received emails from people in São Paulo, Paris, and Los Angeles asking for courts in their cities. The Adopt-a-Park arrangement in New York runs through October 30. If the Parks Department considers the court successful, Public Squash may be able to open more. said Mr. Wall.To handball devotees afraid of a squash takeover, Mr. Wall had this to say: “There are 2009 handball courts in the five boroughs. If we take a hundred of them, that still leaves a lot.”A version of this article appears in print on April 29, 2018, on Page MB4 of the New York edition with the headline: Games of Squash, Without the Ceiling.

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox.The news that Kim Jong-un had extended an official invitation to President Trump appeared to break right as several of the late-night comedy shows were taping, forcing them to handle it on the fly. Stephen Colbert told his audience about it in an unplanned segment after the post-monologue commercial break.
            THIS JUST IN: Trump gets an offer from North Korea that he can't refuse. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/MS9KLAtdqD “This can only mean one thing. Dennis Rodman is going to get the Nobel Peace Prize,” Colbert said.His team was deft in coming up with punchlines on short notice. (And Colbert’s warning that “I’m not entirely sure what I’m about to say” may have indicated that, impressively, he came up with the jokes on the spot.)AdvertisementHe had a few more lines up his sleeve, including:“Because North Korea is an economically starved country, the invitation is B-Y-O-Everything.”“They’ve gone from ‘We’ll blow up Guam!’ to ‘We pinkie swear not to blow up Guam for a few days.’”“We’ll finally figure out who has a bigger button.”“Trump is thinking of making it a national holiday. Not because he supports women: because he wants another day off.” — JIMMY FALLONAdvertisement“KFC replaced its iconic Colonel Sanders logo with his wife, Claudia.” — JIMMY FALLON“President Trump is flying to California next week for the first time since he took office. When asked if he’ll visit LAX, he said, ‘I’ll visit my L.A. ex, my San Diego ex, my San Francisco ex. I have lots of exes all over the West Coast.” — JIMMY FALLON“So the North Korean leader extended an olive branch to Donald Trump, which is a big deal because olive branches are really the only thing they have to eat there.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“By May? He’s not still going to be president by May. This needs to happen by Wednesday. Imagine Kim Jong-un meeting Donald Trump. The two worst haircuts in the world together.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“There’s an attempt to silence porn star Stormy Daniels by President Trump’s lawyer. Yeah. Yeah, it’s kind of sad that, in that sentence, the most degrading job mentioned was President Trump’s lawyer.” — CONAN O’BRIEN“President Trump is planning a meeting about violence with the heads of the video game industry. Yeah. However, some people worry that it’s just a trap so that Trump can deport the Mario brothers.” — CONAN O’BRIEN“In the Northeast, one million people are without power because of a blizzard. Yeah. And in Wisconsin, one million people are without power because of gerrymandering. That one was just for The New York Times.” — CONAN O’BRIEN (Thank you, Conan. We’ve got you.)The greatest sidekick in N.B.A. history, Kobe Bryant, sat down with Jimmy Kimmel to discuss winning an Oscar. His film, “Dear Basketball,” won last weekend for best animated short.Advertisement“I’m still tripping about it,” Bryant told Kimmel.Kimmel asked him what he didn’t get to say in his acceptance speech.“There’s a greater sense of responsibility,” Bryant said. “How do I provide more opportunities for even more diverse and new voices to be heard in this industry? In the animation business, there’s a serious lack of diversity.”Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson, two correspondents for “The Opposition With Jordan Klepper,” did a field segment in Kentucky profiling David Ermold, who is running to replace Kim Davis, the county clerk who rejected Ermold’s marriage license. it was an eyebrow-raising segment. Near the end, Sharp and Jackson confronted Davis at her office to mockingly warn her about her opponent.Jackson said, “Did you know there’s qualified candidates running against you in the upcoming election?”Sharp followed with, “And he doesn’t even want to use religion to take away people’s rights.”In Friday night’s “A Closer Look” segment, Seth Meyers did a deep dive into the recent spate of stories regarding the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. But first, Meyers snuck in a Stormy Daniels barb.“The president of the United States got a restraining order against a porn star, which means we have to say goodbye to the old lowest point in American history,” Meyers said.Meyers then summarized reports that Mueller has obtained evidence that Erik Prince, the founder of the contracting company Blackwater, had met with an ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in an effort to establish a backchannel to the Kremlin early last year.“Wait. You’re telling me a secret meeting on a remote island in the Indian Ocean between a mercenary and an agent of the Kremlin turned out to be suspicious?” Meyers quipped.AdvertisementEnjoy the weekend, everybody. And while you do that, take a gander at this profile of Lionel Richie, who will be a judge on the coming season of “American Idol.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Ken Belson and Benjamin HoffmanORLANDO, Fla. — The N.F.L. believes it has finally figured out one of the most basic aspects of football: what is a catch.In hopes of clarifying what has consistently been one of its most frustrating on-field issues, the league announced on Tuesday that as part of several adopted proposals from the league’s competition committee it had redefined, and hopefully simplified, what constitutes a catch. But the door was certainly left open for future debate.In the simplest terms, a player has to catch the ball, land in bounds, and then do something that demonstrates he has control of the ball.The new definition is similar in spirit to what was previously on the books, but both the main rule and its attached notes were rewritten significantly in hopes of clarifying things for players, officials and fans. The terminology now states that a catch will have occurred if a player, who is in bounds:(a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms before the ball touches the ground; and(b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and(c) after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, performs any act common to the game (e.g., tucks the ball away, extends it toward or over the goal line or the first-down line, takes an additional step, turns upfield, or avoids or wards off an opponent), or maintains control of the ball long enough to do so.The N.F.L. removed the stipulation that a player who has satisfied those three criteria must also survive “going to the ground” with the ball. A player will only have to survive the ground if he has yet to satisfy category (c).The new rule, which was approved by owners with a vote of 32-0, is an attempt to do away with the kinds of baroque rulings that nullified apparent catches by Calvin Johnson of the Detroit Lions in 2010, Dez Bryant of the Dallas Cowboys in 2014 and Jesse James of the Pittsburgh Steelers last season.James, who still believes his catch should have been a touchdown, said the changes should help the game be called more consistently.“Clarification is good for the officials,” he told Steelers.com on Tuesday. “The past few years it’s been clear they don’t know what they are calling.”The sticking point, though, regardless of how many spectacular touchdowns are preserved, could prove to be the issue of fumbles. The “going to the ground” language was introduced to the N.F.L. rule book in 1982 with the goal of eliminating what had become a disturbing trend of fumbles at the end of catches, and this week’s change could inadvertently bring that problem back in full force.At a news conference on Monday announcing the proposed changes, Al Riveron, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president of officiating, acknowledged that significantly changing the “going to the ground” language would most likely mean an uptick in fumbles, but he said that fan pressure was involved in the decision making.“Are we going to see more fumbles? Maybe,” Riveron said. “We want to make these catches catches. That’s what the fans want.”Rich McKay, the president of the Atlanta Falcons, said that he would trade 10 more fumbles for five more memorable catches, and that the league’s history of tweaking the catch rule had led to far too much confusion, necessitating a total overhaul of how catches are handled.“We needed to start over,” he said. “It got to us, we need to get objective standards.”Riveron and McKay acknowledged that it was Bryant’s overturned catch that started the debate leaguewide, but the volume was turned up after Commissioner Roger Goodell vowed to fix things.“I think we can clarify this rule,” Goodell said at his annual news conference before the Super Bowl. “With a lot of hard work, focus, get to a place where — I’m not going to say there won’t be controversy — but we can get to a better place. We have a great opportunity to get this thing right.”Owners said they would still brace for controversial calls. but predicted there would be fewer of them.“This rule change is not gonna solve every single issue, you’re still going to have a certain amount of subjectivity,” said John Mara, the president of the Giants.The league also changed language to try to curb dangerous hits that make use of a player’s helmet, altering the rule book in two places. Under the section on unnecessary roughness, it removes the necessity that contact with a helmet be initiated “violently or uneccessarily” and simply bans the practice outright. In the section on initiating contact with the crown of the helmet, the proposal drastically simplifies matters. It now reads “USE OF THE HELMET: It is a foul if a player lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent.”Benjamin Hoffman contributed reporting from New York.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

Wells is considered by historians to have been the most famous black woman in the United States during her lifetime, even as she was dogged by prejudice.
Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. Now, we’re adding the stories of other remarkable people.1862-1931Took on racism in the Deep South with powerful reporting on lynchings.By CAITLIN DICKERSON MARCH 8, 2018It was not all that unusual when, in 1892, a mob dragged Thomas Moss out of a Memphis jail in his pajamas and shot him to death over a feud that began with a game of marbles.

MARCH 8, 2018

By Nitsuh AbebePeople may talk about generations as though they proceed in some orderly parade, but it’s really more like a tug of war: Whichever age group outnumbers the others gets to pull an entire society deep into its own habits, neuroses and preoccupations. As a result, one of the best ways to understand popular culture is simply to consult a chart tracking the number of Americans born each year. Most prominent will be the huge swell of people born after World War II, who have dominated the national psyche for as long as any living person can recall. Then comes a 1970s trough, a tiny cohort of poor souls who will never dominate anything and are best known for being sardonic about it. Then comes a rally, and another peak: American adults, at the moment, have a pronounced tendency to have been born around 1990. A lot of our cultural noise these days is just the sound of a nation’s center of gravity shifting, all at once, across four entire decades — and landing on a group of people who, whether they realize it or not, can now manhandle the world the same way their elders did.Except, of course, when it comes to pop music, the subject of this special issue. When it comes to pop, “people born around 1990” are already done for. They are approaching 30! It is a testament to their influence that popular music has already spent a decade doggedly attached to the same stars who took over the charts during this group’s teen years: Taylor Swift, Drake, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Beyoncé (as an object of worship and not just a good R.&B. singer), Kanye West (as a regal personality and not just a determined rapper). It has been an impressive run.Now it feels as if that run is ending. Millennial pop was a ball of earnest confidence and self-assertion; it even managed to make Katy Perry, who hit it big dressing like an elaborate dessert and singing about parties, turn woke. But a certain skepticism has collected around its pantheon of stars: One false step, and the world is more than ready to roast them online and laugh them back to irrelevance. The artists emerging to replace them seem interested in darker things — doubt, depression, failure.Then there’s the really fascinating part. People in their 20s are having a new experience: They are, for the first time, noticing some of the things actual teenagers enjoy and are being completely appalled, both morally and aesthetically. A flood of young rappers is scoring hits with music that baffles grown rap fans with its slurry boneheadedness — plus they’re as alarmingly devoted to pharmaceuticals as rock stars once were to heroin. Various bits of viral jackassery (Jake Paul’s hit YouTube channel, Danielle Bregoli’s troubled-teen appearance on “Dr. Phil”) turn nonmusicians into pop forces, too. While 20-somethings were earnestly debating the intersectional politics of Beyoncé videos, some number of their younger counterparts were trawling the internet wilds, fixating on kids with face tattoos eating Xanax like popcorn and setting things on fire.If the last version of pop was driven by people who desperately wanted everyone to care and everything to matter, it’s only natural for the next wave to be interested in what it looks like when you don’t care, and nothing matters. There are areas of pop that could use a yank back toward wrestling with the stranger, murkier parts of human experience. Not that any adult can tell you whether that’s in the cards: Keep scanning along that birth chart, and it will emerge that the highest number of births in American history seems to have come around 2007. If you want to know where music is going, ask an 11-year-old. ?Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for the magazine.An unapologetic anthem for women in a year otherwise defined by pandering and setbacks.By JAMIE LAUREN KEILESWomen in this world are taught to believe that every problem must have a buyable solution. Not sleeping well? Get a lavender-vanilla pillow spray. Overrun with stress? Buy a skin-care routine. The market is rife with solace for sale — a product on offer for anything that ails. This past year, our own systemic subjugation was no exception. With a former beauty-pageant owner in the White House, Clinton in Chappaqua and high-profile men being exposed for their crimes, feminism reached its most shoppable form: pink pussy hats, enamel pins of vulvae, shirts that proclaimed “The Future Is Female.” These trinkets and tchotchkes brought comfort to their owners, but as a political response, they felt comically feeble. In a culture that tolerates violence against women, denies our health- and child-care needs and polices our sexual conduct and bodies, why would empowerment ever look cute?Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow” arrived as a valuable 3 minutes 44 seconds of frankness in a year of feminist pandering. The song debuted on June 16 and climbed the charts until it reached the top, spending three weeks at No. 1. It opens with a sparse and foreboding beat — the trap-music answer to the “Twilight Zone” theme. Cardi begins with an outright provocation: “Lil [expletive], you can’t [expletive] with me if you wanted to.” Her tone is confident in a way that feels easy. To paraphrase one commenter on YouTube: It’s a song that will make you want to fire your own boss.Cardi B, 25, grew up in the Bronx and worked her way to independence as a stripper. She first appeared in the public eye when she started posting charismatic videos on Instagram: infinitely watchable micromonologues on everything from dating, love, family and friends to media, terrorism, grammar, orthodontics and the finer points of three kinds of oral sex. As a public figure, her image is capacious, a mix of the bawdy antics of Fran Drescher and the quotable wisdom of Ecclesiastes. Cardi embodied these contradictions with ease, while other stars floundered. With public declarations of empowerment in fashion, many defaulted to a vapid middle ground, positioning themselves as generically “relatable” (Jennifer Lawrence) or taking a stand for wan concepts like love (Kendall Jenner).Compare “Bodak Yellow” with Rachel Platten’s “Fight Song” — the soundtrack to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Over swelling piano, Platten strings together blithe imagery about hearts, voices, friends and oceans. By avoiding precision, she tries to please us all. When she gets to the chorus, she belts out: “This is my fight song/Take-back-my-life song/Prove-I’m-alright song/My power’s turned on/Starting right now I’ll be strong.” Is it a song about a breakup? About asking for a raise? About electing a woman president, or all of the above? Who could say? The hook is perfectly pitched for group singing, but Platten seems afraid to offend. What kind of anthem runs on nervous trepidation? In “Fight Song,” empowerment is just another pursuit in which women must bend over backward for approval.Cardi B, by contrast, does not speak on behalf of womankind. On “Bodak Yellow,” she talks about herself and herself only: her Louboutins, her mixtapes, her checks from the television mogul Mona Scott-Young. (Between dancing and rapping, Cardi honed her persona on Scott-Young’s VH1 reality show, “Love & Hip Hop.”) “I’m a boss, you a worker,” Cardi raps. When she deigns to think of other women at all, it’s only to write them off as a nonissue: Other women pay to party, while she gets paid to party. These sentiments are far from Platten’s brand of rising-tide empowerment; here, Cardi has the only ship. If the song does not toe any feminist party line, then it certainly empowers more than many things that do. Nobody listens to “Bodak Yellow” and imagines herself as the girl who pays to party.From the beginning, rap has performed this kind of alchemy, turning systemic disadvantage into power. In “Bodak Yellow,” just one person emerges victorious: Cardi B. And like the best writers, she conjures this power from specificity and verisimilitude. Anyone who follows Cardi online can vouch that the contents of the song are largely true: She used to dance for money but no longer does; at one point she did, in fact, “fix her teeth.” And they know that her persona was constant from the start — always silly, always angry, always sexy, always smart, always fed up, petty or exhausted. If her brand of bravado feels distinctly female, then it’s only from doing what rappers have always done — starting from a place of truth. Female rappers have done this before, but never for an audience so desperate to be spoken to directly.“Bodak Yellow” does not seem to care whether you think it’s an anthem. In a world where women reflexively say “sorry” for walking past other women in the hall, Cardi knows that the truest act of power is exercising the right to remain silent. “If I see you and I don’t speak, that means I don’t [expletive] with you,” she raps. Other anthems aim to please; Cardi’s conjures a world in which women don’t need to please anyone at all. ?Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in Queens.

Striving — and failing — to be a better ally.By WESLEY MORRISDuring the 2017 Grammy Awards telecast, Katy Perry performed a single from her first new album in four years, called “Chained to the Rhythm.” Built around the bright slosh of resort reggae, it was as much a frozen daiquiri as a song. Wearing a white tuxedo-with-bustier number and a shaggy blond bob, Perry sang lines like “So comfortable, we’re living in a bubble, bubble” and “We think we’re free,” yet “we’re all chained to the rhythm.” On her right sleeve was a spangled band that read “resist” — a tribute to the inaugural Women’s March, which had just taken place. The picket fence she stood behind came straight from the song and sat on a cantilevered stage that revealed Skip Marley, one of Bob’s grandkids. He rapped while she did jumps and thrusts. When it was all over, they stood together, their arms up in solidarity, before a projection of the words “We the People.”Perry was, as they say, in a mood. Her candidate had just lost the presidency, and she wanted us to know she was bewildered and mad as hell. Only she didn’t sound mad. She sounded like Katy Perry — mad sunny, hella happy. But she was trying — trying to emote for the country, trying to indict our complacency, trying to matter.Perry kept trying. In anticipation of the June release of her fifth album, “Witness,” Perry embarked on a daffy foray into stunt therapy, an awkward conflation of self-interrogation and self-indulgence. She spent a long weekend mansion-bound and live-streamed, repositioning herself as emerging from a state of cluelessness. Do I appropriate when I dress like a geisha or wear cornrows? And, like, what do I do with that? In a comical chat with the Black Lives Matter activist and podcaster DeRay Mckesson, she sat on a white couch in a heavenly white space whose mailing address might as well as have been “the Cloud.” Her legs crossed, her heart open, she confessed that the long, fraught history of black grooming was news to her. A friend had to set her straight. “She told me about the power in black women’s hair, and how beautiful it is, and the struggle,” Perry said. “And I listened, and I heard, and I didn’t know.”That admission echoes the conflicted silliness of “Chained to the Rhythm.” The song both works and works against itself. That kiddie-pool Caribbean sound evokes 1980s radio without overtly invoking any of it. The pinballing, steel-drum-ish twinkle arrives just faintly enough that it seems to be coming through a blown speaker, perfect for Perry’s singing to surf it until the chorus. This is a low-calorie version of the island life that pop has been touring for decades, which is clever, because it obliquely winks at what the song is too meek to look at head on — the way some white artists and listeners love black culture without necessarily seeing black people, their politics or their pain. That, of course, nudges the song’s chain imagery — and the way it evokes Grace Jones’s 1985 hit “Slave to the Rhythm” — into tone-deafness. It doesn’t bring to mind white complacency as much as actual black bondage, a clumsy move that is its own kind of complacency.The live-streamed therapy, the plea of ignorance, the delight of the actual song — they all land near the center of the Katy Perry vexation matrix. Perry might be the most naturally likable pop star we have. Who else has her ungovernable goofiness? Her greatest songs are called “Teenage Dream” and “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)” and “Firework.” Some of her very good songs are called “Birthday” and “This Is How We Do.” Once, at the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show, she managed to both resurrect Missy Elliott and make a star of a dancing shark. Some singers are acrobatic. Katy Perry is aerobic.Nobody this good at plastic flowers should be this bad at thorns. That conversation with Mckesson was meant to exonerate her of obliviousness. But if that’s true, why do the pleading from a spa? She was discussing her wish to better understand her place in the world without any proof that she has actually understood. What it sounds like Perry wanted was for other people to do her work for her. If nonwhite people don’t show her where the racial guardrails are, how can the accident report blame her? Maybe that’s somebody trying to be a better ally, but it also sounds a lot like somebody asking for a chauffeur. ?Wesley Morris is a staff writer for the magazine, a critic at large for The Times and co-host of the podcast “Still Processing.” Opening photograph: Lester Cohen/Getty Images.Something strange and wonderful and urgent comes courtesy of Edinburgh.By JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVANThe first time I heard the most interesting newish band in the English-speaking world was at a sort of music-video party in North Carolina. I don’t know how to describe it, really. My friend who ran it, Grayballz (the only name by which I’ve ever known him), who is a kind of impresario and community organizer and actor in commercials and purveyor of herb, put it together for a film festival. He likes videos, music videos like we used to watch on MTV and still can on YouTube. Grayballz thinks the form is alive and underappreciated. In a big room there were about 20 fancy TV screens. It was dark in the room, with strange purple laser lighting. I think there was fog involved. What I remember clearly, though, is one of the videos Grayballz had chosen. I saw it without knowing the name of the band or anything about them, not what country they were from, nothing. The video showed a kid who looked either European or Southern Ohioan. He was wearing a tracksuit and had a sort of severe thuggish haircut, bangs chopped straight across his forehead. He was bleeding from part of his face, as if he’d fallen or been cut in a fight. And running. Just running down a road. At a certain point he stopped and performed a remarkable improvised-looking dance. That’s all. But the music is the reason I remember. The music was pulsing and upbeat, possibly electronica or some kind of dance music, but soulful and kind of rocking. Falsetto notes skipped above an urgent melody line. The song was called “Shame.” The words went, “Nothing but a barefaced lie,/Is all you [expletives] can hold onto./I suggest you downgrade fast,/before it’s a shame on you.”When they wrote that, had they been thinking about any particular group of [expletives]? It sounded so personal.“Yes,” said Alloysious, or Ally, Massaquoi, one of the frontmen in a band where everyone is the frontman (except for the drummer they play with, Steven, who by being the one person who is not a frontman seems at times the most conspicuous person onstage.)“Will you tell me who the [expletives] were?” I asked.“No,” Ally said.He was born in Liberia and has memories from there but moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, when he was 4. We were in the basement of the building (a former brothel) where Young Fathers record in Leith, which used to be a little town outside of Edinburgh but is now essentially a neighborhood, a 20-minute bus ride from the city.Two black guys from African immigrant families, a white guy from Scotland, all of them Scots: Young Fathers. By one account, they called themselves that because when they were very young — the three founding members got together when they were only about 14 — people told them they were too serious. The name was meant to make fun of that quality in themselves while at the same time embracing and declaring it. (More frequently they say it comes from the coincidence that they are named after their fathers.)Earlier that morning, G. — Graham Hastings, “the white guy in the band” — met me at the house where he grew up in Drylaw. It was council-estates, working-class housing. He took me back to the bedroom where Young Fathers were born: inside a cabinet, or a sort of wardrobe thing. They would actually climb into it Narnia-style, to cut tracks, doing vocals over beats that G. was creating with a forgotten computer program called eJay. “[Expletive] little beats,” G. said. “Little loops like a jigsaw puzzle.” In those days Young Fathers had been almost like a boy band. They all danced in sync. When they performed at hip-hop nights, people had no idea what they were doing. Yet strangely, given their youth, Young Fathers knew.I asked what it meant to them, being from Edinburgh. Were they an “Edinburgh band”? They said yes but in a no sort of way. They explained that Edinburgh essentially has no popular-music scene. “Edinburgh is literally a quiet city,” he continued. “People start up venues. Then somebody complains about the noise, and they shut it down. I’ve been in studios where a guy has come in with a meter, a sound meter.”Mainly Young Fathers loved this about Edinburgh: its relative indifference to their success. That gave them a bubble to work in, to be themselves in, so they just kept doing that. When I asked G. what had led to his production style, which is special for its starkness, for the diversity of the sonic worlds he’s able to create with a few machines, he answered, “It was basically just not knowing much about what was happening.” When Young Fathers won the Mercury Prize in 2014 for “Dead,” the BBC remarked that “almost no one owns this album.”From the beginning, people told them they were strange. What was the white guy doing with those two black guys? Were they from Africa or something? What kind of music was it? (“Pop,” Young Fathers say. They prefer that term because it is meaningless.) Even in London it might have been harder to imagine. There are a lot more black people, for one thing — these two Afro-Scottish pop musicians would not have been forced to make common cause with this local white dude. “The identity of being a Londoner,” Ally said, “solidifies the culture.”It has proved trickier to wield this tool, of provincialism-as-strength, when it comes to race. Especially with American audiences. Politically, the Fathers are engaged and informed, but their political statements tend not to track with what we are used to hearing here. This is another reason to value them. The socio-racial reality in which they were raised is both similar to and different from ours, in such a way that they are in a unique position to see the profound insanity of American race-obsession, “insanity” as in popular delusions and the madness of crowds. Scotland can be plenty racist, they assured me. Alloysious and Kayus Bankole even said they sometimes prefer the open, ugly racism of the States over a kind so silent and polite it keeps you wondering. “It can make you paranoid,” Ally said, rubbing his hands on his head. It was true, though, that you had more breathing room here (neighborhoods weren’t organized racially, for one thing). At the same time, through their love of hip-hop, they grew up immersed in American popular culture. This is especially true for Kayus, who lived for some years in Maryland. He described the weirdness of arriving there and finding himself forced — or not forced, really, but compelled — to conceive of his musical choices as racial. I’m a black kid, therefore I like X. There was a thrill in it. There was also a mental straitjacket. Whereas in Edinburgh, his musical choices could be just that. Lou Reed’s “Berlin” was one of his favorite records.Young Fathers have a remarkable song on their last record titled “Old Rock n Roll.” I’m somehow both captivated and offended by it, but more the former than the latter, and the latter feels more and more creatively disturbed. The video for it was shot in Malawi, in a village. Alloysious and Kayus are dancing with the villagers and looking into the camera, doing rock-star things. The beat is sort of chugging, with a tinkle of dissonant notes that repeats, but there’s a propulsive African thing behind it. The first verse grunts and groans: “I’m tired of playing the good black .../I’m tired of having to hold back .../I’m tired of blaming the white man/His indiscretion don’t betray him/A black man can play him.”For an American, it is instructively defamiliarizing to be talking with an African-born black man and have him open his mouth and say something in a full-on “Braveheart”-level brogue. There are YouTube videos of old “white” women speaking in thick Jamaican patois that have the same effect on me. A thing you thought was racial, an accent, turns out not to be. And in the moment of that correction, you can feel the texture of human nature. Like with the music . . . I’m not sure a white man can be fully legit, writing these things in 2018. In the spirit of Young Fathers, I will resist the impulse to suppress them. The band’s attitude seems to be: If it’s human, it’s allowed in. Ideology comes second. Take the line, “I’m tired of blaming the white man.” To an American it sounds like a selling out of the civil rights movement! But outside the vortex of our national politics, it’s ... what? I don’t know. A human thought? A thought that would occur to any person who yearns to know what it feels like to exist outside a psychological matrix based on bogus and scientifically nonexistent racial categories? Maybe! “Personality taking precedence over candor,” Kayus said, an excellent phrase that for him summed up the band’s attitude. They admitted it was complicated, how a line could change in crossing a border, but said they were more into stoking the conversation than being careful. “That song ends with a question mark,” Ally said.There’s a funny moment in the “Old Rock n Roll” video when they cut to Graham in a field. You’ve been wondering where he was the whole time. I guess having the white dude dancing around in the African village was a step too far even for Young Fathers. But at a certain point in the song, you see G. sort of thrashing around by himself in a field. The verse he is chanting goes: “Old rock and roll/It’s not what you’ve been sold./Congo Square is open for business./I was there, as God is my witness.”Congo Square in New Orleans: where the slaves were allowed to play music together on Sundays. Resulting in: many of the most excellent parts of American popular music, which has been a global music for two centuries. Congo Square is one of the wellsprings. What did it mean to say it was “open for business”? That the old system was alive inside the new. That we were being lied to about something.The new Young Fathers’ album, “Cocoa Sugar,” is an Edinburgh record in the special sense defined by the band: It doesn’t care. It doesn’t sound as if it was made in preparation for an oncoming rush of fame. As a result, it’s relaxed enough to feel its instincts. Check out “Fee Fi,” the second song. What sounds like a visiting female rapper is Kayus rapping in drag. The attack is slithery, a baby-talk voice that wants you dead: “Nice set of knives, gimme a slice/I like your flesh, I know what’s best/You can be my cause of death, dressed in Sunday’s best.”Young Fathers are changing. Ally mentioned chameleons three times. Whatever happens commercially, they have made the record they wanted to make for 2018, with no detectable compromises. As far as that goes, they are still in the cabinet. ?John Jeremiah Sullivan is a contributing writer for the magazine.The soundtrack to your adolenscence.By Jenna WorthamIn 2013, during an appearance at Temple University, the actor Will Smith shared an anecdote about his younger child, Willow, an actress who had made an unexpected turn to music. Her debut single, “Whip My Hair,” an addictive pop song about originality and nonconformity, became a hit a few years earlier, and Smith now wanted her to star in a remake of “Annie” that he was co-producing with Jay-Z and others. According to Smith, Willow looked at him and said: “Daddy, I have a better idea. How about I just be 12?’”Willow was asking for the chance to be a kid, and for the next few years, she did exactly that. Even as her entire family somehow became even more famous, she turned inward. Her Instagram feed showed her on road trips, at sleepovers, climbing trees, hanging out with friends on the beach. In one of my favorite photographs, she’s in TriBeCa, wearing a backpack and hugging an inflatable globe, grinning in an un-self-conscious way, her face and shoulders scrunched with the unrestrained delight that few famous girls display in public.Two years later, she returned to music with a full-length album called “Ardipithecus,” whose sound echoed the SoundCloud trends of the time, minimalist vocals paired with drum-machine beats, but it’s “The 1st” from 2017 that feels like her true debut. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Willow explained that she named the album for the tidal wave of new experiences happening in her life, both musical and, in her words, “human social situations,” like falling in and out of love. “The 1st” is both an archive of her teenage years (the album was released on her 17th birthday) and a session on the therapist’s couch.The album opens with trilling violins and a tender confessional: “Hey, Mom, I met a boy.” The banality is immediately a relief — though not boring; not even close. If SZA made an album for the wandering existentialism of your 20s, Willow scored the soundtrack of the time right before that. To listen to this album is to witness a metamorphosis from girl to young woman. Willow cycles through personas in sound the way other teenagers might swap hairstyles or silhouettes, but the effect feels honest and fresh, a reminder of what it’s like to shape-shift by trying on a new pair of clothes or falling into a new group of friends. “Human Leech” is a grungy anthem of regret and anger, “Lonely Road” an emo tribute to independence and the instrumental “An Awkward Life of an Awkward Girl” feels like a preppy piano recital. The album ranges around, reinventing itself with every turn. It’s the lyrical version of a newly born colt getting its earth-side legs. “The 1st” isn’t always smooth, but it’s mesmerizing.Willow learned how to play guitar for the album. It wasn’t easy, she has said, but it taught her about yielding to life’s difficulties. “You start to become friends with the process,” she said in the Rolling Stone interview. The fruits of that labor are most apparent on the song “Warm Honey.” The song opens with a confident guitar riff, then breaks into a relaxed and steady rhythm that begs to be blasted in a car while driving with the windows down, hair — or tears — streaming in the wind. Willow’s voice starts in a falsetto, luxuriating in the remains of her prepubescent vocal register. “My self never seems like enough,” she sings in a plaintive whine. Her voice strengthens as she gets wistful. “I’ll be walking for miles, searching for miles, trying to find myself.” By the time she reaches the end of the song, she’s belting with her full diaphragm in a yell on the verge of primal: “I know it’s never enough.” It’s the overwrought language typical of any teenager, but it’s also exactly what makes her music so appealing. An adult should know better, but teenagers are allowed, even celebrated for, their strength of feeling.Willow has always been a spiritual precog, interrogating our concept of reality and pursuing enlightenment with her brother, Jaden, and this song is appropriately trippy, casually referencing light beams and third eyes. Once you get to the end, a mantra appears in a hypnotic loop. “But then I realized, I don’t exist.” It’s an offering — Willow as teacher, eager to share the lessons of her preternaturally prodigious adolescence with anyone else who might be lost on the journey of trying to find themselves.Willow said that Alanis Morissette was an inspiration; Tracy Chapman and Fiona Apple also seem to be aesthetic forebears — all women who made careers raising the consciousness of other young women, showing them alternatives beyond the processed filter of pop culture. Willow is now making her own contribution to that canon. There’s no easy point to “The 1st,” no pithy conclusion, beyond leaning into your self and whatever you find there. It’s an album that mines feelings and creates some along the way. That’s what our teenage years are about, after all: becoming friends with the process. ?Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine and co-host of the podcast “Still Processing.”Photograph by Jun Sato/Getty Images.An indie heroine of the ’80s and ’90s finds her way back.By Rob HoerburgerIt’s the niceness that grabs you first, makes you suspicious of her — and once you’ve determined that it’s real, it can make listening to her like watching an Olympic performance and holding your breath with every jump. The first time she showed up on my doorstep, in 1988, she was on the cover of “Idlewild,” an album by her duo, Everything but the Girl, on a label that was also Madonna’s. But while Madonna once sang-scowled a song called “Love Don’t Live Here Anymore,” Tracey Thorn was singing a gentle, grammatical soul ballad called “Love Is Here Where I Live.” How was a singer like her ever going to survive?But survive she did, turning modesty into an asset. There would be the occasional commercial juggernaut; a club mix of “Missing,” E.B.T.G.’s Magdalene-at-the-tomb lament, was a surprise No.2 pop hit in 1996. But becoming a star on the level of Madonna or Beyoncé was probably never in the cards for a former post-punk androgyne with a catholicity of tastes (a short bridge for her between Stevie Wonder and Morrissey). With Ben Watt, her musical and life partner, she flowed her deep voice — deliciously plummy, little aches lurking — into multiple tributaries: jazz, dance, alt-folk. Along the way she became the darling of a large coterie of fans who came to expect that she would softly but firmly pull back the skin of her songs, letting hypnotic melodies — as in “Protection,” her collaboration with Massive Attack in which she essentially midwifed trip-hop — leak out a trickle at a time.Thorn is 55 now, and her latest release, “Record,” pumps some vigor in a career that had seemed to be downshifting. (Since her last album of all-new material, in 2010, she has written two books and put out a Christmas collection, sure signs of a career summing itself up.) The synthscape of the new album pays homage to vintage New Order and Pet Shop Boys tracks, and despite the modern feminista stance of the lyrics, you can’t help thinking, initially, that the route she has taken to artistic rejuvenation is nostalgia. On the album’s closer, “Dancefloor,” she sings of “where I’d like to be,” with “some drinks inside of me, someone whispering it’s quarter after 3.” Is she looking up into a disco ball and seeing a rearview mirror?But the past spins into the present in the song’s C section, where, oddly enough, Thorn name-checks tracks she loved in her youth — David Bowie’s “Golden Years,” Evelyn (Champagne) King’s “Shame,” Chic’s “Good Times.” Though these songs are four decades old, she knows that they can still turn the dance floor into a place of liberation and communion. (They’re part of a canon, she told me recently.) Then she hears someone else singing, “and I realize it’s me.

I do, because some nights, all nosy and obsessed with self-improvement, I trawl Spotify for insight into the human condition. Each playlist is a window into people’s idiosyncratic formulations of what’s sexy and what it takes for them to feel that way. It’s a horny kibitzer’s dream.The thing about peeking into people’s intellectual sex windows, though, is that you can end up rattled. It’s chilling to discover that someone would prefer “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” not by D’Angelo but by Matt Bomer, redone for the “Magic Mike XXL” soundtrack, and that I could accidentally have sex with this person one day. According to Spotify, the most common songs on people’s sex playlists — that is, on playlists that contain some variation of “Sex Playlist” in the title — are all on the nose. (And yes, Spotify tracks this; don’t be surprised to find ads like LIVE WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF THE 11 PEOPLE WHOSE SEX PLAYLISTS ARE JUST GINUWINE’S “PONY” OVER AND OVER AGAIN sometime soon.) Six of the top 10 songs contain the word “sex” in the title: “Birthday Sex,” by Jeremih, is the most common, along with “Sex on Fire,” by Kings of Leon (No.6), and “Sexual Healing,” by Marvin Gaye (No.8) — proving that most people build their lists simply by typing “sex” into the search bar. Recently, I spotted a version of “Hallelujah” by the a cappella YouTube sensation Pentatonix on a playlist called “20 Best Christmas Songs to Have Sex To.” Someone, somewhere apparently has peppy, classic, all-American sex to Gene Kelly’s “Singin’ in the Rain,” and someone else has managed to scrub the single-take, treadmill-choreographed viral music video from her head and use OK Go’s “Here It Goes Again” as a tool of seduction.Hours of research and a rich, fulfilling personal life have led me to this: The ideal sex playlist should gesture at a mood without demanding it. It isn’t a necessary accessory to an action — if anything, it’s the soundtrack to the prelude. A sex playlist is not really meant for what happens in the bedroom (kitchen/living room/car), but whatever happens to get you there — the background noise to a shared cigarette on the couch or two more beers from the fridge, a balm to the nervous energy coloring the room like a stain. The best music is vaguely unrecognizable, something you almost certainly don’t know the words to. Chief among all: The songs can’t be about having sex. (Close your eyes and imagine actually having sex to a song like “I’ll Make Love to You.” Does death suddenly seem attractive?) According to Spotify, the second-most-common sex playlist song is “Sex With Me,” by Rihanna, in which she purrs, “Sex with me is amazing/with her it’ll feel all right.” You cannot have sex to this song, because even if it makes you feel like Rihanna, it’s still fundamentally about Rihanna talking about how she’s better than you.Here’s a song that works: “Anita,” by Smino, a 26-year-old rapper from St. Louis. At its core, it’s a song about yearning — not about having sex but about wanting it, the musical equivalent of two knees too close to each other on rickety bar stools. The song is built around the idea that if you try hard enough, the name “Anita” and the plea “I need her” can and do rhyme. His supplication, impossible to replicate yourself without scrunching your eyes and curling your hands into a fist, feels like a homage to the way Gaye performs desire: the way he emphasizes the middle of a word or drags out vowels, his way of begging for more.Smino’s entire first album, “blkswn,” is moony and goofy and comfortably youthful — another track starts, “I got a pizza on the way, bay-bay/I’m trying to lay, lay/little lady, aye” — but “Anita” is the standout. It’s faintly galactic, all video-gamey beeps and boops, with the overlay between Smino and Jean Deaux, the vocalist, representative of what can go right when two people are in perfect rhythm. It’s appealingly unobtrusive, warm and indistinct, able to melt into any background it finds itself in. And if — in the midst of a little action — you happen to catch that it’s playing, all you’ll think is: This is nice. ?Jazmine Hughes is an editor for NYT Magazine Labs.Photograph by Michael Salisbury.How to turn self-doubt into a superpower.By LIZZY GOODMANEarly one arctic February evening, at a grimy Sheraton in suburban Maryland, the singer and songwriter SZA was wandering around her hotel room, pantsless, awaiting the arrival of the doctor her assistant, Amber, had been researching online. (“I Googled and Yelped him as much as I could, and all the reviews are good,” Amber said, nervously.) They’d been through this routine a few times before, when the singer’s voice abandoned her or her body went on strike. Like the time before SZA played “Saturday Night Live” late in the fall, six months after her debut album, “Ctrl,” was released. And again a few weeks ago, before she was set to shoot a Mastercard commercial in New York, then fly to Chicago for a show, then to Hawaii for more shows, then back to New York to perform at the Grammys, where she was nominated for five awards, the most for any woman this year.That time, though, she was actually sick. This time the 27-year-old felt physically fine; her voice just wouldn’t work. Earlier in the afternoon, she had to go out and explain this to the crowd of fans gathered at NPR’s “Tiny Desk” studio set in Washington. “As soon as I get a shot in my booty, I’ll be fine,” she insisted, drawing a sympathetic laugh from the crowd. Later in the night, she would try to open up her throat by hot-boxing her hotel bathroom with a blend of eucalyptus steam and weed smoke. But first, cortisone.“I don’t have pants on, let’s get right to it,” SZA rasped, greeting the doctor at the door in an oversize Harley Davidson T-shirt and sweat socks. He asked where she was from (Maplewood, N.J.) and for her real name (Solána Rowe) and, as he sorted through a pouch of vials, what “SZA” — pronounced like “sizzah” — stood for. “It’s an acronym derived from the Supreme Alphabet,” she said, with practiced poise. “Each letter stands for a different ideology.” The singer grew up in a conservative Muslim household, though she’s now more spiritually omnivorous than she was as a child. “Every now and again I might feel like, yo, I just need some straight-up Jesus today,” she told me later. “Or sometimes I feel like there’s a sura that can bring me into a really great space, or I just need the right meditation, or I need to talk to my mom.”The doctor loaded up his syringe. “Okey-doke: buttocks,” he commanded. SZA lifted the hem of her T-shirt and bent over slightly. Afterward, as the doctor packed up his gear, he reiterated how important it was that SZA rest her voice for a few days. She laughed. “I might be getting worse,” she said with a bright smile, “but I’m not mentally acknowledging anything.”If you believe SZA’s own words, it’s a miracle her critically adored, commercially successful breakthrough album ever was released. “I actually quit,” she tweeted back in October 2016. Her manager, she wrote, “can release my album if he ever feels like it. Y’all be blessed.” This was after she had put out a couple of promising EPs and become the first woman signed to Top Dawg Entertainment, also home to Kendrick Lamar. She was seen as a kid sister to the tight-knit, supermasculine Top Dawg crew — and as her generation’s prime contender to carry the torch of R.&B. greats like Lauryn Hill, one of the most famous graduates of SZA’s own New Jersey high school. SZA’s music is unabashedly emotive; she writes with explicit candor about sex; with her cascading pile of hair and tendency to sing with her eyes closed and one hand outstretched, Streisand-style, she is the picture of the classic soul diva. But SZA was also born in 1990 and is a product of a post-internet culture, armed with the staggering diversity of reference points and influences that is the hallmark of the millennial mind. Like the music of Frank Ocean, her lone generational peer, her work feels deconstructed: imagistic, casual-seeming sketches that in their scattered imprecision convey the 24-7 slide-show feeling of modern life with breathtaking accuracy.Anticipation was high for the interminably forthcoming “Ctrl,” and SZA’s tweet generated a flurry of news. But these “I quit” moments — an impulsive stomping of the foot when things don’t feel right — are actually pretty common for the singer. SZA and her team even have a name for the phenomenon: “Elmo-ing,” after the alternately excited and terrified red Muppet. They might pull up to a red carpet and find the singer refusing to get out of the car: “I just can’t, because I’m deeply Elmo-ing,” she says. “It’s a social-anxiety thing where it’s like you don’t recognize yourself.” Her manager, Terrence Henderson, known as Punch — president of T.D.E., which his cousin Anthony Tiffith, known as Top Dawg, founded in Compton, Calif. — explains it in comic-book terms. “SZA’s like Jean Gray, so I guess I play the Professor X role,” he says. “She’s definitely a Level 5 mutant. You can’t control it. You just got to try to contain it.”“Ctrl” was released in June 2017 only because Punch refused to let SZA work on it anymore. “One day they just wouldn’t let us go back to the studio,” she says. And though the record’s wildly positive reception should feel like a fairy tale of validation — it has been certified platinum, fueled a sold-out tour and earned her endorsements with Gap and Nike, not to mention all those Grammy nominations — SZA still fixates on the “two more weeks” she wanted in the studio. The thing is, Punch says, “she comes from a background where she was teased a lot, so she developed a lot of insecurities early on. She just doesn’t see herself like the rest of us see her.”Self-doubt may actually be SZA’s superpower. In an era of aggressively cultivated self-confidence — of squads and scars that are beautiful and sometimes performative hashtag feminism — SZA has broken through singing songs that exult in self-doubt, desperation and insecurity. On “Supermodel,” a song about an ex who leaves for a “prettier” woman, she laments, “Why am I so easy to forget like that?” On “Drew Barrymore,” she sings:I’m so ashamed of myself think I need therapyI’m sorry I’m not more attractiveI’m sorry I’m not more ladylikeI’m sorry I don’t shave my legs at nightHer obvious forebears may be girl groups like the Crystals and the Shangri-Las. But unlike those artists, who were made abject by their desire and imprisoned by the gender politics of their era, SZA’s insecurities are refracted through the ensuing decades of cultural and social progress — through waves of feminism and the civil rights movement, through Madonna and riot grrrl and Sasha Fierce. She wears her old-school insecurity with a decidedly modern bravery, expressing her own self-loathing with such clarity and conviction that it comes across as self-love.Her success gets at a complicated truth: Neediness and regret are not merely the products of some pre-woke world in which women weren’t given the space to be self-actualized superheroes. They’re part of the experience of being human. SZA’s Grammys performance took place two weeks before “Fifty Shades Freed” became the No. 1 movie in America, and while her music has little in common with that film, both are clearly giving women something they want, something they aren’t getting elsewhere and often feel ashamed for desiring in the first place. Some feel women should have evolved beyond the retrograde parody of male-female desire the “Fifty Shades” franchise reflects, a more nuanced and sophisticated version of which runs through SZA’s music. But SZA isn’t ashamed or confined by needing to feel hot enough to keep her man; she is legitimately freed by the act of expressing it. After more than a decade of pop’s relentless calls to self-love, admitting you sometimes hate yourself — admitting you’re “lonely enough to let you treat me like this,” as SZA sings on “Drew Barrymore” — is a relief, an act of rebellion.Onstage at the Fillmore outside Washington back in February, SZA asked the crowd if high school was as brutal for them as it was for her. They whooped loudly. The crowd looked to be mostly middle-class, arty black kids in their late teens and 20s — the sort you might see portrayed on Issa Rae’s “Insecure,” the second season of which featured a lot of SZA’s music. (The album, Rae once tweeted, made her wish she had a bathtub, weed, candles and a temporary man.) But SZA’s reach is as diverse as her influences. When she played the full album to the producer Mark Ronson and Kevin Parker of the band Tame Impala — who are working on an album together and had SZA in the studio as a potential collaborator — Ronson says the two stared at each other in amazement. “Sure enough,” he says, SZA went on to become “the coolest name to drop, the music that everybody loves, even people who aren’t necessarily into R.&B. She just became the thing.”SZA’s calls to the outcasts feel believable because rejection — real and imagined — is still such an evident part of her life. Backstage after the show at the Fillmore, she cataloged some of the embarrassing things she has done to avoid interacting with her own heroes. “I told Beyoncé I had to go poop,” she said. This was the first time they met, and SZA did not in fact need the bathroom. “I just said, ‘I really need to poop and find weed,’ and she was like, ‘... O.K.’ If I put my foot in my mouth early, then I remove the risk — we all know I might do something worse.” This is the self SZA sees: a hyperactive weirdo whose inner monologue — flitting, as it did during the days I spent around her, from the various types of dog dander to face serums that smell like urine to astrology — always threatens to mark her as the kind of reject she says she was as a teenager.One of SZA’s oldest and closest friends, Ashley, started out as one of her bullies. “She was a grade ahead of me, and she was really cool and really pretty and had all the new clothes, and her brother was older and really cool,” SZA says. Even after they made peace, “it would still be weird. Like, the girls she would have me hang with would spit in my face or try to fight me.” She was a 10-year-old in a head scarf in a New Jersey commuter town when the twin towers fell. Later, it was her weight that marked her for abuse. In her early 20s, SZA was carrying more than 200 pounds on her 5-foot-4 frame; she has posted photos on Instagram.On paper, the singer had as much of a shot at a smooth adolescence as any young person of color in an affluent American neighborhood. She lives in Los Angeles now, but she often stays in her childhood home when she’s on the East Coast, and she speaks about the backyard, with its “two big maples and a cherry tree,” with wistful sweetness. As a child, she was close to both parents — her Muslim father, who worked for CNN, and her Christian mother, an executive at a nonprofit. But she also says she has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and didn’t take medication for it until she was in college. “My mother just doesn’t believe in it,” she says. “I’m black, so it’s like nobody going to no doctors for ADHD. ‘Sit your ass down and pray, you’ll be fine.’” When she was a kid, activities were her Ritalin: science camp, horseback-riding camp, church camp, softball, dance, cheerleading, track. As a high school sophomore, she was one of the top gymnasts in the state, but she soon grew “too tall and too thick” to stay competitive. “It was like, aerodynamically speaking, I kind of need to be a little slimmer and a little shorter if I really want to pop the way I want to pop,” she recalls, shrugging. “And if I can’t win, I don’t want to play.”When I suggested to her mother, Audrey Rowe, that raising SZA couldn’t have been the smoothest experience, she laughed and said: “That’s an understatement.” Pushing her to focus on a college education, as her parents had, was an uphill battle. “She is brilliant,” Rowe says, but when it came to dictating her path, “I should have known better with that Scorpio.” SZA’s success has wound up feeling like a vindication for both of them. Rowe used to wonder if she was giving her daughter too much space — “but she’s the kind of spirit,” she says now, “that almost demands that.”At Madison Square Garden, a few days before the Grammys, Punch sat in a bank of chairs reserved for the country group Little Big Town and watched SZA rehearse. It wasn’t going well. I asked if this was the worst part — watching her anxiety, so pronounced that it sometimes seems capable of taking physical form, emerge on one of the biggest stages in the world. He chuckled. “Not for me no more,” he said. He has learned to steer clear in moments like this. “I used to try to figure out ways to fix every single thing she’d complain about, but now it’s like. ...” He trailed off. She doesn’t really want it fixed? “Right.” The anxiety is fuel? “Definitely fuel,” he affirmed. “And I believe in her talent so much I know she’s going to kill it no matter what happens before.”SZA really has become the kid sister of the T.D.E. club. “The clubhouse is the studio,” Punch says, “and she comes in doing cartwheels and handstands — she gets away with murder!” So much so that Punch has started teasing the boss, Top Dawg: “I be like, ‘Bro, you’re getting soft.’ Because he gives her anything she asks for and he never gives it to the guys.”It’s different, managing a woman, and not just because Punch has found himself in meetings with skin-care brands or in line to buy tampons. “With the guys, I can call them and be like, ‘Hey, we got an interview in 30 minutes, get dressed.’” He snaps his fingers. “I tried that with her before. It didn’t work so well.” And she doesn’t care about the same things; the types of internet comments that T.D.E.’s rappers can laugh at, Punch says, might really bother her. “It’s not to say that my guys don’t have insecurities; everybody has them, they just manifest in different ways.” Jay Rock, for example, is most concerned with “what his projects think — his neighborhood.” And when I ask who Kendrick Lamar is trying to impress, Punch muses: “At this point, he fightin’ the mirror.”Some part of SZA is still trying to get mean girls to be nice to her, whereas Lamar, who was already a rap prodigy in high school, grew up the king of his realm. “And even going deeper with him,” Punch says, “his confidence, like, he’s been shot at coming home from high school, you know what I mean? That’s the alternative to making these records. We all come up that way, and she didn’t. She’s from the suburbs. So our tough love is a little different from hers.” She has, in his estimation, adapted. “She’s grown so much,” he says. “She learned our world as well.”Punch remembers meeting SZA for the first time, at a 2011 performance by Lamar; she was there helping with merchandise. “She looked very distinctive,” he says. Much to her parents’ dismay, SZA had dropped out of college by that time, having cycled through “like four different schools” and almost as many majors. She put her short attention span to practical use, pogoing from marketing gigs to retail jobs, bartending at a series of strip clubs, sleeping on friends’ couches. The day after the concert, she was delivering some swag to the guys’ hotel and asked her friend Ashley to come along. But when they met Punch in the lobby, Ashley didn’t even take her earbuds out. “She was low key being rude,” SZA says. Finally, somewhat annoyed, Punch asked Ashley what she was listening to. “And she’s like, ‘It’s her!’” Punch says. “‘You didn’t know she sings?’”“I don’t know, there’s no segue that makes sense, I don’t have one for you,” SZA told me at the Sheraton, post-cortisone, as we sat on the floor of her bathroom and watched the air fill up with steam. “It just happened.” First a boy she liked was making music with her brother and asked her to sing something, so she gave it a shot. Through a long series of aimless coincidences, she found herself onstage, billed as “Dylan,” covering an Amy Winehouse song at a showcase held by the production duo Christian Rich. She was still thinking she would find her way to a career in the environmental sciences, or maybe fashion, but songs were also pouring out haphazardly: She would simply steal beats she found on YouTube, sing over them and throw them back online. “I didn’t really have any aspirations,” she says.It was Punch, at first, who had the aspirations: As soon as he grabbed one of Ashley’s earbuds and heard SZA’s tossed-off home recordings, he was sold. “Her voice was very distinctive,” he remembers. “So already the look is distinctive, and the voice is distinctive, and then she approached her lyrics like a lyricist, like a rapper.” Ronson was struck by that same quality. “Even if she was just speaking these lyrics, she would still be the best M.C. out there,” he says. “And she’s singing.”It was the day after the Grammys that SZA woke up sick, a start to the troubles that would eventually have her searching for doctors who do house calls. Her performance on the show, though riveting, felt subdued. And she wound up losing all five of the awards for which she was nominated.Those losses weren’t entirely surprising. We may live in a pop world ruled by the likes of Beyoncé and Rihanna, but women are wildly underrepresented when it comes to the Grammys’ most prestigious awards. No black woman has won Album of the Year since Lauryn Hill in 1999. When the hype over SZA’s five nominations ended in a shutout, it felt to many like yet another example of the Grammys’ trading on the cultural power and influence of women of color without ultimately recognizing their work. And then, backstage at the awards, Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy, told Variety that women have only to “step up” if they want to be musicians, engineers, producers or executives. SZA had met Portnow and liked him. “He was a chillaxed dude with mad cool trinkets in his office and hella cool stories about said trinkets,” she remembers. His comments left her “hurt and confused” — “and then it made me feel like, damn, were you thinking that about me when we met? Were you looking down at me?”But part of the benefit of being so haunted by your own doubts is that you have little room to indulge other people’s. As she sat on the floor of that musty hotel bathroom, dirty makeup sponges and discarded false eyelashes on the counter, a battered copy of a devotional text called “Jesus Calling” on the tile next to the toilet, her voice shot, SZA was jubilant in a way I had not yet seen. The chaos inspired her. As she and her 21-year-old creative director, Sage Adams, passed a joint back and forth, giggling conspiratorially, I asked what I might learn if I stayed out on the road with them for another week or two. SZA’s eyes widened. “There will be so many moments that I’ve never been through before!” she exclaimed, her brow furrowing. “I’m going through mad first times, and you want to be like, ‘It’s my first time — give me a break!’” She paused and took a long drag. “Actually, I don’t need a break. I just got my second wind.” ?Lizzy Goodman is a journalist and the author of “Meet Me in the Bathroom.Videographer/Editor: Steven Rico. Stylist: Dianne Garcia. Hair: Randy Stodghill. Makeup: Raoul Alejandre. When a joke becomes a hit.By ANGELA FLOURNOYA human mouth can’t accurately reproduce the sound a gun makes, but I love to hear rappers try. No matter how serious the context, there’s something whimsical about the effort. My favorite gun sound is ScHoolboy Q’s “yawk yawk yawk”; it calls to mind a bird more than a firearm, and ScHoolboy’s startling, louder-than-the-verse delivery of it amuses me. The same is true of Waka Flocka Flame’s redundant “bow bow bow,” which often appears on tracks that feature actual gunshots. Kendrick Lamar’s go-to “doot doot doot doot” is hilarious because of Lamar’s earnestness — he wants so badly for you to feel the urgency. With the exception of ScHoolboy, it’s unclear whether the intention is for me to feel concerned that the rappers in question are familiar enough with the sounds of violence to impersonate them or for me to laugh. Men don’t like it when you laugh at the wrong thing.So it was with relief that I happened upon “Mans Not Hot,” a song by Big Shaq, a character played by the Ghanaian-British comedian Michael Dapaah. Here are over-the-top gunshot onomatopoeia begging to be lampooned, even dragged out for maximum enjoyment. “The ting goes skrrrrra/Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka/Skidiki pap-pap/And a pu-pu-pudrrr boom.” It’s highly doubtful these noises mimic any real-world firearm, but Dapaah knows what good poets know: Sound matters just as much as meaning.In a video for Genius, Big Shaq explained the conceit of the song: “Man’s not emotional, man don’t cry, there’s a lot of things man don’t do.” Indeed there are. “Mans Not Hot” highlights the sort of posturing that young men adopt when they’re worried someone might find them uncool or, worse yet, soft. There’s the disdain for men who express fear, even when being shot at (“when the ting went quack quack quack/you man were duckin”); the expectation for women to flock to them (“if she ain’t on it, I ghost”); the resolution to stay cool, figuratively and literally (“The girl told me take off your jacket/I said, ‘Babes, mans not hot’”). It’s a funny, softer take on #masculinitysofragile, a perennial Twitter conversation about the myriad ways heterosexual men limit themselves to adhere to a rigid set of gender expectations.“Mans Not Hot” takes aim at rap tropes themselves, but unlike straightforward parody songs — say, Chris Rock’s “Champagne” — it’s believable enough that if you’re not up on your memes, you may think Big Shaq is just another over-the-top rap personality prone to wisecracks. Quality production helps. The beat derives from a song called “Lets Lurk,” by the London group 67 and the veteran rapper Giggs, but if “Lets Lurk” sticks to the genre expectations of British grime — driving bass, regimental snares, tightly wound, innuendo-laden lyrics about holding guns and moving drugs — “Mans Not Hot” is its goofy younger brother, refusing to take himself so seriously.The origin story of “Mans Not Hot” is a weird one. It begins on Charlie Sloth’s “Fire in the Booth,” a segment on a BBC radio show. Dapaah appeared first as a nervous, overly earnest character called MC Quakez, who struggled to deliver a freestyle verse despite the encouragement of a hype man called Shakes. It was at this point that Dapaah switched into another character, Roadman Shaq — “roadman” being slang for a London street type — and took over the mic. The standout moment of Shaq’s subsequent performance was that litany of implausible yet unforgettable gun-onomatopoeias. An in-studio video went viral; Dapaah capitalized on the moment by replacing the “Roadman” in his moniker with the more universal “Big” and releasing an actual song.In an interview on American radio’s “The Breakfast Club” back in October, Dapaah had an awkward exchange with one of the hosts, Charlamagne Tha God. “Mans Not Hot” had finally grabbed listeners’ attention across the pond, and Dapaah was trying to explain that he’s not actually a rapper; he just plays one from time to time. “I don’t go to every single place as Big Shaq,” he said, “because I don’t want people to think that’s all that I do.” Charlamagne was scandalized, insisting that Dapaah should have never broken character because, in his estimation, more women would sleep with Big Shaq than with Michael Dapaah.Maybe. In 2018, what we consider authentic and what we deem an act seem less important than what can attract and sustain attention. Consider the 14-year-old rapper Bhad Bhabie, née Danielle Bregoli, who harnessed an internet-famous appearance on “Dr. Phil” into an actual record deal and enthusiastic actual listeners. Never mind that she works with co-writers and has no previous experience; she’s a rapper now because she says she is. On “The Breakfast Club,” Dapaah’s aims felt old-school by comparison: He wanted to embody a thing to poke fun at it, without being consumed by it. But then, last fall, he signed a record deal with Island Records UK.Time will tell whether Big Shaq’s origin story will recede. What I can report is that a few days before the new year, I was at a nightclub in Nairobi, the sort of place that feels cringe-worthy — abundant empty space, picnic tables with bottle service — until suddenly the dance floor is full and you’ve sweat through your shirt. Around midnight, the DJ dropped the opening of “Mans Not Hot” with Dapaah’s voice booming, “Yo!” A gasp of recognition went up. Some dancers grinned, clearly enjoying a meme-turned-hit with the requisite sarcasm. But others, mostly men — the Nairobi equivalent of roadmen, maybe — weren’t laughing. They had their fingers in the air as Dapaah’s artificial baritone rattled off his fake gun sounds. It didn’t seem they were in on the joke, much less aware that they might be the butt of said joke. To them, Big Shaq was just another rapper giving them an excuse to look tough in the club. ?Angela Flournoy is the author of the novel “The Turner House.Photograph by Joseph Okpako/Getty ImagesA declaration of womanhood, K-pop-style.By LINDSEY WEBERUpon first listen, I’m not quite sure that I know what’s happening in IU’s “Palette” — a song sung almost entirely in Korean — only that I love it. There are a few words in English (“hot pink,” “pajamas,” “lipstick”), but it’s the chorus that reveals something recognizable: “I like it, I’m 25,” she sings breathily above a groovy bass line that sounds more R.&B. than anything. “Ooh, I got this, I’m truly fine.” (I doubt that. Has anyone ever been “truly fine”?) The music video shows IU in flux between youthful long hair and a modern bob, performing maturity by doing things like choosing a purple shade over baby pink, wearing stodgy striped pajamas and listening to vinyl. We’ve all been through this phase before — someone’s having some growing pains.In a way, Lee Ji-eun — she goes by “IU,” meaning “I” and “you” — reminds me of Britney Spears, both for being a young solo star holding her own among a wave of trendy pop groups and for her midcareer rejection of ingenuousness. (IU’s fans call her Nation’s Little Sister, a title she has since rebuffed. No word on whether she’ll shave her head.) By the Spears metric, then, IU is probably in her “Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman” phase: She’s going through the age-old ritual of defining her womanhood in front of millions of fans. I was 16 when Spears released her classic single of pubescent angst — I, too, was neither a girl nor a woman, just an insecure teenager looking to glom onto someone else’s liminality to make mine less intimidating. So when I heard “Palette” for the first time — and figured out what it meant — it offered the same sort of emotional salve that Spears once did. Not knowing the words only helped — it allowed me to project myself inside her aspirations of maturity.The Korean pop music that most appealed to the West used to be sort of manic — like “Gangnam Style,” the ebullient, hugely viral 2012 song — but IU is one of K-pop’s rare chart-topping singer-songwriters, and her proficiency of introspection is compelling because she’s almost able to slowly crack away at the genre’s clichés. I listen to a lot of K-pop, and all the songs seem as if they’re written by 17-year-olds who love good jams and bad lyrics. It can feel so superficial — “Your heart will be filled with my image/You’ll look for me even when you’re dreaming,” goes one of my favorite Red Velvet songs. But IU emits an authenticity I haven’t found elsewhere. She’s honest, singing in Korean: “Oh, why is that? I like things that are a little old-fashioned, filled palettes rather than paintings, journals and times I was asleep.”It makes me feel the way I did when I first heard Britney sing “feels like I’m caught in the middle.” But Britney’s now 36, and I’m 31: proudly gravitating toward bridge, half-marathons and cottage cheese — my version of IU’s old-man PJs. IU and I are each obsessed about growing older, but I can give her some elderly advice: You’ll cry growing pains all the way there, but when you’re finally an adult, you’ll still feel like your 16-year-old self — no bob haircuts or record players can change that. Either way, we’re each going to be truly fine. ?Lindsey Weber is a freelance writer and editor living in Brooklyn. She co-hosts the pop-culture podcast “Who? Weekly.” Songwriting from the right side of addiction and recovery.By WILL HERMESAlthough he had pretty much quit smoking, Jason Isbell stood on the sidewalk in Troy, N.Y., six hours before a show across the Hudson River, in Albany, enjoying the one daily cigarette he’d been allowing himself since falling off the wagon not long ago.This was relevant for two reasons. One is that, three days earlier, in late January, Isbell won a Grammy for “If We Were Vampires,” in the Best American Roots Song category. (He and his group, the 400 Unit, also took home the Best Americana Album award for “The Nashville Sound.”) In the song’s titular couplet, Isbell sings: “If we were vampires and death was a joke/We’d go out on the sidewalk and smoke” — an image that suggested itself because he’d just quit and was thirsting, mightily. “It wasn’t subliminal, that line,” he recalled. “It was the absolute foremost thing on my mind. I wanted a cigarette.”The other reason, most Isbell fans know: his personal and artistic narrative of addiction and recovery, specifically to and from alcohol, which he quit five-plus years ago after being forced out of the critically lauded, Alabama-rooted Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers. Sobered, he found a successful solo career and recognition as one of America’s most inspired songwriters, a triumph that informs both his lyrics and his working-class-hero persona.The title of “Vampires,” with its echoes of Buffy and Bela Lugosi and “Twilight,” is actually a bit of a feint. “Vampires” is a quietly gripping song about mortality. It contrasts simple, unshakable images of human need — a “hand searching slow in the dark,” “nails leaving love’s watermark,” the urge to hold on to another — with the immortal undead, who can afford to laugh at those of us whose days are numbered. The scene recalls the restless spirits in George Saunders’s recent “Lincoln in the Bardo” (a novel Isbell adores and whose author he’s now friendly with), and the idle amaranths of Jim Jarmusch’s “Only Lovers Left Alive” (a film Isbell also admires).His song, however, was spurred by something more prosaic. One afternoon, Isbell was sitting on his bed, watching the reality show “Hoarders” — recovery narratives, basically. His wife, Amanda Shires, and bandmate and also a gifted singer/songwriter, was annoyed; she was working hard in another room, trying to finish her poetry M.F.A. from the prestigious program at Sewanee. “You’re making your record next week,” she scolded. “You need to be writing. Anybody can watch ‘Hoarders.’” Chastened, Isbell turned off the set, and after a few hours of work he announced that he’d finished a song, which he then played for Shires, haltingly. “He started crying,” Shires recalled. “Then he said: ‘I’m an idiot. I’m crying at my own song.’”The chorus repeats:It’s knowing that this can’t go on foreverLikely one of us will have to spend some daysaloneMaybe we’ll get 40 years togetherBut one day I’ll be gone, or one day you’llbe goneWhen they write, Shires and Isbell act as each other’s sounding board and editor, reviewing word choices and refining their work. This time, though, Shires said: “That’s perfect. You don’t need to touch it.”After lunch at Troy Kitchen — a business incubator in a revitalized neighborhood that lets cooks develop restaurant models as food stalls — Isbell and I headed for Collar City Sweet Shoppe. A former iron-and-steel town, Troy is known as the Collar City for its standing in the detachable-shirt-collar trade. “It reminds me of Birmingham a lot,” Isbell says, referring to the once-booming steel city in his home state of Alabama. “Birmingham was a big deal for a time. But then the business went elsewhere.”Isbell’s upbringing was working class. His parents had him in their teens; his father painted houses. Isbell is finally doing well for himself, and it shows in his presentation: hair trimmed, stylish sunglasses, neat beige overcoat, wool Stetson ivy cap and immaculate bright-purple terry-cloth Tretorn hightops, which, he noted, were designed by a fellow Southerner and musician, André Benjamin, of Outkast. Isbell’s roots, though, are still evident in his songs. In “Vampires,” he rhymes the central conceit of “maybe time running out is a gift” with “I’ll work hard till the end of my shift.”He also considers broader contexts. “Hope the High Road,” from “The Nashville Sound,” stakes out emotional common ground in a divided country. (“I know you’re tired and you ain’t sleeping well/Uninspired and likely mad as hell” are lines that likely resonate on both sides of the aisle.) Another song on the album, “White Man’s World,” is about privilege and demonstrates how vexed it has become to hear the phrase “white man,” which seems to get more traction as a supremacist’s affirmation or an activist’s pejorative than as a simple statement of fact. “And therein lies the point,” Isbell said, chuckling. “That’s why you have to say those words. And it’s interesting to me how often the ‘man’ part goes unnoticed in that song. I’m talking about, among other things, the way women’s issues and the issues of black people intersect, y’know? I’m singing just as much about one as the other.”Isbell tours states red and blue, playing cities large and small. At the Palace Theater that night, following a set by James McMurtry — one of Isbell’s songwriting heroes — a gentleman, seemingly a few drinks in, hollered at the empty stage: “Hurry up! I gotta be at work tomorrow!” Soon Isbell emerged with the 400 Unit, a Southern version of the E Street Band: airtight, versatile, featuring a hotshot guitarist (Sadler Vaden) and the bandleader’s mate (Shires, in this case on fiddle). The couple sang “Vampires,” looking into each other’s eyes. On the Truckers’ song “Decoration Day,” five voices rose in unison on the line “I got dead brothers in East Tennessee.” During “White Man’s World,” a few people in the overwhelmingly white male audience ducked out, for whatever reasons; those remaining sat curiously still. Isbell hopes to open a few minds in his audiences, which seem split between presumably liberal indie-rock stalwarts and presumably conservative mainstream country fans. But he concedes that, like many of us, he still lives and works in a bubble, and if certain fans are put off, so be it. “If somebody decides to get up and walk out on that song,” he says, “I don’t really care, y’know?”Backstage in their cramped, shared dressing room after the show, Shires removed her makeup with a cleansing pad; Isbell managed to wedge his head into the tiny sink, rinsing sweat and Kevin Murphy styling cream out of his hair. He was looking forward to a day off the next day — his 39th birthday. He was scheduled to be in Providence, R.I., where his plan was simply to relax and maybe shoot some pool. Back when he was drinking, he often played for money, but when he got clean, pool halls became “a little bit of a trigger,” so for a time he avoided them.There’ll be cake, of course, with his bandmates, his wife and their young daughter, Mercy. Thanks to a nanny and a dedicated “family bus,” Mercy can travel with her parents when they’re on the road together, though they weigh the pros and cons of touring with their little girl. On the downside, there are the risks of hours spent in motor vehicles. On the up, there’s all that beauty and human diversity to experience in the wide world. Mercy is just 2, but “she’ll remember things,” Shires said, especially “all the different kinds of people she’ll meet.”Isbell agreed. After all, our kids’ minds are the ones most available to us for opening. Maybe she won’t be so scared, “like everybody in America is,” he said, “because she’s meeting all kinds of people.” ?Will Hermes is the author of “Love Goes to Buildings on Fire.” He is currently writing a book about Lou Reed.Her white-girl naïveté has started wearing thin.By AMANDA HESSIn 2009 — the year that Taylor Swift’s ballad “Love Story” rose up the pop charts — the CMT Music Awards opened with a parody of the song. A rap parody. It was called “Thug Story.” Dubbing herself “T-Sweezy,” Swift posed with T-Pain in front of fancy cars and threw indiscriminate hand gestures. She rapped about knitting sweaters, baking cookies and living with her parents. She wore a diamond-plated grill.Small white women improbably rapping has been a popular genre of comedy video; now Swift has casually transformed it into a legitimate pursuit. On her latest album, “Reputation,” Swift raps again, and it is a testament to her strange cultural position that people seem mostly fine with this — even at a time when debates over racial appropriation rage, when actual white nationalists have claimed Swift as their chosen pop star and when her rep is still reeling from the night on Snapchat when Kim Kardashian branded Swift as a double-crossing snake out to bite Kanye West.Could it be that Swift is somehow too plainly white to be credibly accused of “acting black”? She is a country-crossover artist and the 28-year-old forever-bard to teenage white girls everywhere. That used to mean singing morality plays about football games, her dad and mean boyfriends. But look at the Billboard charts: Today’s pop music is, ultimately, a black idiom, and any white person who intends to be a pop star must find some way of negotiating that fact. You can adopt black styles, or you can pointedly reject them, or you can do what Swift has done — judiciously pick her way through hip-hop’s sonic creations in a way that serves to reinforce her naïfish white-girl brand.Swift has never been a standout singer, but she is pop’s great enunciator, and her “rap” performance is seeded with white-girl affectations that blunt its edges. Swift has always positioned herself as an underdog, even as she rose to become a music-industry monolith, and charging into hip-hop allows her to reassume that gawky posture. So before she begins her verse on “Ready for It,” we hear her primly clear her throat. Her rap voice is giddy, careening on the verge of laughter, as if she were self-consciously barely pulling it off. On “End Game,” she drops into her Valley-girl lilt (“I swear I don’t love the drama”) before sliding back into the digitized cadence she uses to pose as straight R.&B. (“... it loves me”).That song exists in the middle distance between professional hip-hop track and white-girl fan tribute. Swift brings in the rapper Future for a verse, then gives another to fellow not-rapper Ed Sheeran, a white artist also working around the edges of black pop sounds. The vibe is reinforced by the video, in which Swift plays at executing vaguely urban dance moves on a boat with Future before retiring to giggly bopping with Sheeran at a karaoke bar. She incorporates just enough elements of black music into her brand, and deploys them just cannily enough, to skate through this pop moment basically unscathed. Financially, anyway — the album sold more than a million copies in its first week.But after reigning atop the music industry for a decade, her whole project suddenly feels under review. Her defensive girlishness no longer sits well; her political flavorlessness seems suspect; and when she does speak out, it’s over petty personal slights. It used to feel, reading the party line of pop criticism, that disliking Swift made you a little bit sexist — in an industry that remolds young women to its specifications, Swift represented the rare pop star who seemed to write her own story line. But for all her crossover success, the songwriting skills that made her a country girl-power icon don’t translate so easily to hip-hop-dominated pop, where it’s increasingly pointless to center an artist whose talents don’t chiefly lie in rapping, singing or dancing. Swift herself hasn’t changed, but now embracing her too eagerly reads as somehow racially oblivious. The mockery has broken wide open on black Twitter, where dunking on her “unseasoned chicken” whiteness has emerged as a cherished pastime. Swift can still extract great returns by leaning into her lucrative brand, but as the cultural winds shift around her, its value is at risk of depreciating.After she lays her hip-hop tracks at the top of “Reputation,” she returns to a more recognizably Swiftian approach in the second half of the album. And in the song that most directly addresses her ongoing feud with West — “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” — she summons her whitest cadence yet, affecting an upper-crust accent as she complains: “So why’d you have to rain on my parade?/I’m shaking my head/I’m locking the gates.” The song is about casting a back-stabbing friend out of her Gatsbyesque mansion — her Rhode Island compound, perhaps, where she holds her elite Fourth of July parties — and instead of slipping back into a rap rhythm for the chorus, she leads a head-cheerleader chant: “This is why we can’t have nice things darling/Because you break them/I had to take them away.” Swift is still acting like a teenager, but here she reduces West to a child. It’s classic Swift, as broadly catchy as it is self-serving, and in 2018 it feels a little desperate too. Swift is still in the pop mansion, but lately it feels as if she is standing at its threshold. One misstep could get her voted out. ?Amanda Hess is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Photograph by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.A YouTube celebrity’s slapped-together rap song hit the Billboard HOT 100 — and terrified adults.By JEREMY GORDONYoung people are terrible and defiant, and each successive generation finds new, innovative ways to offend their elders. A healthy attitude accepts that some phenomena are bound to remain beyond your understanding, but when these feelings of revulsion do not dissipate, every adult must consider the worst possible scenario — that after years of resisting inertia, you might finally be out of touch. It was with this spirit that I patiently tried to wrap my head around Jake Paul, the insanely popular YouTube star who has built a rabid following of almost 14 million viewers, and who makes me acutely aware that my millennial generation is getting up there in years.Nearly every day, Paul records a lengthy video detailing his moneyed, rabble-rousing Southern California life. He and his friends — a collective called Team 10 — try to buy luxury automobiles using pennies, prank their friends and family, get asinine tattoos for fun. Paul, 21, comes off as an affable and annoying frat brother leading rush week; his channel is essentially a reality show about his life, and when he isn’t following through on concepts like “INSANE DEAD BODY PRANK ON TEAM 10,” most of the time he riffs manically for the camera.In a May 30 video titled “You Won’t Believe What We Did,” he laid out a self-imposed challenge to record a rap song and film a video in one day, which he claimed might be the first time in history. (This feels untrue, but who knows?) He recruited a producer and a studio, and found a mansion in the hills and a glamorous car for the shoot, while documenting and narrating the whole process. Paul laid down a track, and true to his word, he uploaded a finished product, titled “It’s Everyday Bro,” within hours. In another era — say, four years ago — this might have been a curio released to a niche fan base; in 2017, it racked up millions of plays and actually hit the Hot 100, as Billboard now incorporates digital streams when calculating chart position.On “It’s Everyday Bro,” Paul sounds like what he was: a first-time rapper writing his bars with the help of a punishing, self-imposed time restraint. He raps mostly in the parlance of media-drunk teenagers, referencing his impressive YouTube statistics and laying down a challenge to PewDiePie, owner of the most popular YouTube channel in the world. He frequently falls off the rinky-dink beat, and his brash, boyish voice hovers at a dull monotone through the entire song. Rap metaphors need not always be complex or even particularly clever if they’re sold by a charismatic personality, but he sounds like an automated voice assistant when dropping clunkers like “We chew ’em like it’s gum.”The presence of several other Team 10 members only turns “It’s Everyday Bro” into the wackest posse cut ever recorded. There is Nick Crompton, a James Corden-esque Brit with a gravity-defying haircut who raps, bewilderingly, that “England is my city.” (His rhymes were written by the geographically challenged Paul.) There is Chance Sutton, who strikes an oddly villainous tone when rapping about his social-media following; the sole woman, Tessa Brooks, who admonishes her haters for eating at Panera; and the Martinez twins, handsome Spanish brothers who plead with Donald Trump for a visa. It’s standard hip-hop braggadocio filtered through every negative stereotype about the amoral vapidity of Generation Z, performed by amateur musicians who sound as if they’re doing karaoke. And again, it charted.“It’s Everyday Bro” is exceedingly unpleasant to the point that it actually lowered the bar for every song I heard for the rest of the year; all I would have to think was, It’s not as bad as “It’s Everyday Bro,” and that would be enough to pardon anything. Paul is hardly the first entertainer to be loved by the kids for unclear reasons, but he is somewhat novel in the fact that his product is himself — and that before YouTube, he could have never become successful in this specific, multidisciplinary way. And if you peek down the wormhole of original YouTube material, which is increasingly produced by these narcissistic personalities, it’s easy to understand the growing panic as parents finally realize whom their kids have been learning from. (Paul’s older brother, Logan, who is also a YouTube star, recently came under fire for filming his crew gawking at a dead body in Japanese’s famous suicide forest and, well, using a Taser on a dead rat.)Paul’s brazen annexation of chart space puts every millennial adult in the unenviable position of becoming a cultural reactionary, passing judgment on the youth, like the uptight authority figures we never thought we’d become. But his success potentially augurs a future where every teenage-ish idol with decent engagement numbers will be enticed to write some raps — no matter how bad — and reap the potential rewards. (The teenager Danielle Bregoli, who went viral for being rude on “Dr. Phil” and turned this into a sizable Instagram following, is signed to Atlantic as the rapper Bhad Bhabie.) In the future that we’ve built, the critics don’t matter; the only important thing is finding a way to give your fans what they want, whether it’s a video blog or a new song. If it beggars belief that someone like Jake Paul can inspire such unending devotion, this confusion is the point. “They said we couldn’t do it,” Paul says during the video about the making of “It’s Everyday Bro.” “Oh — we’re going to do it.” Though he never clarifies this, it’s obvious who “they” are — me, you, the rest of the adults and all the haters. ?Jeremy Gordon is the culture editor at The Outline.A marriage of song and sound, onstage and behind the curtain.By RYAN BRADLEYFor the half of the year that the singer, songwriter and pop savant Charli XCX lives in Los Angeles and not her native London, she stays in an old Tudor-style house up a canyon in Hollywood. When I arrived there on a recent Monday morning, one of her housemates — an old high school friend named Katie Rowley, whom everyone calls Twiggy — greeted me at the downstairs gate. After showing me around the house, she made us tea. Charli was busy around the corner, in the breakfast nook. While we waited for her, Twiggy told a story about Charli’s sports career.In high school, they were on the same netball team. Netball, Twiggy explained, is a bit like basketball, only most players can’t move around the whole court — your position dictates where you can go. Charli played midfield and was very good, and she was moved up to a wing attack position. “So she could score more?” I ventured.“Not really,” Twiggy said. “She was best at setting up goals. Assisting? Assists.”This made perfect sense: Charli is excellent at assists. Five years ago, when she was just 19, she wrote a song about smashing cars and partying and not caring, which she decided not to record herself, because, she said, it didn’t feel particularly cool to her at the time, or like something she would want on her album. The song, “I Love It,” was recorded by Icona Pop instead (Charli did backup vocals) and went to the Top 10 nearly everywhere. Charli then co-wrote Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy,” which went to No. 1 the next year, in 2014. Charli had a hit of her own soon after, with a song called “Boom Clap,” which was also a kind of assist; it soundtracked key moments in the film “The Fault in Our Stars.”The song helped her break through as a solo artist, but it marked her. For a while, Charli told me, she was known as the “‘Boom Clap’ girl,” which she found exasperating. But having a hit like that helped her better understand her own relationship to fame and success. She canceled a tour and began logging more and more studio time, writing constantly — for Gwen Stefani, Rihanna and, more recently, Blondie — while surrounding herself with producers who made the kind of music she heard at 4 a.m. when she’d been out dancing all night. “I write plenty of songs that are technically good, but they are not songs I would like to go out and listen to,” she explained. “I like going to really weird clubs, so I guess I’m not going to do nice radio songs. Maybe that’s selfish. But it’s difficult to be convinced into something.”There’s an old story in pop, about young artists (women, usually) shaped by the studio Svengalis (men, always) who are the real, not-so-secret geniuses behind the acts. Charli, in many ways, is both the genius behind and the one in front, writing songs and shaping sounds for herself and for others. But the studio, and what happens inside it, are misunderstood by the rest of us, she said. When I asked her what she thought people often got wrong, she pointed to the popular idea that hits are, essentially, written by committee.“The song starts from one or two people,” she said. “And,” she added, “really big pop artists, someone like Taylor” — Swift — “or Katy” — Perry — “people often underestimate how much they bring to the table. There are so many production credits.”Charli has always juggled pop instincts with her slightly stranger, less crowd-friendly inclinations — with the kind of sounds she encountered at 4 a.m. at the weird clubs, or what she considered cool, which is often, almost by definition, at odds with what is popular. For much of her career, these twinned tendencies toward and away from pop have been in conflict. She wrote megahits while her albums were indie darlings. But last year felt like a true arrival, or emergence, where song and sound were perfectly married. She had collided what had been in conflict, that yin and yang of the cool/weird and the popular, and found a new sound. In December, she released a mixtape called “Pop 2.” This was on the heels of another mixtape she released in March, and in July, a single called “Boys,” plus a video she co-directed for it that contains a who’s who of scene-y men and brilliantly flips the usual music-video male gaze upon itself. Later in the summer, she and her frequent collaborator and producer A.G. Cook cut an entire album’s worth of songs they didn’t release, just because.Like everything on “Pop 2,” the December mixtape’s enigmatic title — a sequel, but to what? — was a collaboration, suggested to her by Tommy Cash, an Estonian rapper who is one of the mixtape’s many guests. Charli also made tracks with CupcakKe, a Chicago rapper; Pabllo Vittar, a Brazilian drag queen; and Kim Petras, a transgender German singer and model. Only two of the 10 tracks on “Pop 2” feature no other voice but Charli’s, and even then, she often sounds obscured, her voice bubbling in the depths of a stew of synths and autotune, as though the record, recorded in New York and Los Angeles, were then shot into the farthest reaches of the galaxy, where members of some advanced alien species remastered it to their liking. There is no good reason “Pop 2” should hang together — the varied sounds, the different artists, the way the songs often warp significantly to accommodate the different artists’ different styles — except that at the center of it all is Charli XCX.“I think I’ve realized I really gravitate to people who are very extreme,” she told me, by way of explaining the range of her collaborators on the project and in her life right now. We were sitting out in the courtyard; inside, Twiggy was D.J.-ing, and Charli occasionally muttered to herself the words to the hip-hop songs Twiggy was playing, almost like a mantra. “I don’t like vagueness in artistry,” she continued. “I’ve been there before, because I’ve been vague or unsure.”I remarked that she seemed more interested in the process of song-making than in the result.“That’s it,” she said. “I just really love being in the studio and hate everything else. I don’t really write songs in the house. I like going places.”By which she meant: the studio. She was going back later that day, with Cook and Petras. She’d been going five or six days a week since early January, writing at least a song a day. I asked her if there was a song on “Pop 2” that she felt was especially indicative of things to come — different songs on the mixtape seemed to point toward distinctly different possible pop futures. “There’s a song called ‘Track 10,’” she began, then stopped and started talking about another track, the album’s single, “Out of My Head.”Of the two songs, “Track 10” is the one I find more sonically interesting, beginning almost as a lullaby before it expands its sound to something dark, dense and foreboding, the twinkle of the lullaby remaining all along. It’s a weird, wonderful track, and perfectly Charli; it’s also one of the two with no guests, just her. But Charli wanted to highlight the more dance-friendly number, which features Tove Lo and Alma, Swedish and Finnish singer-songwriters, who dominate the first verse, the hook and the chorus, all before Charli even arrives to sing. She also wanted to talk about Sophie, one of the track’s producers and a frequent collaborator. She couldn’t help herself. It was just in her nature. She was a wing attack. She gave assists. ?Ryan Bradley is a writer in Los Angeles.Photograph by Gabriel Olsen/Getty ImagesA rapper’s redemption song — of a kind.By JONAH WEINERGucci Mane pulled up to a Miami recording studio in his McLaren 720S, a six-figure supercar the color of Smurf skin. It was a recent purchase, and he’d been documenting it on Instagram with the doting relentlessness of a new dad: Minutes before he arrived, I saw a video of the suede-accented cabin on my phone, posted while he drove over. After the Atlanta-bred rapper, who is 38 and was born Radric Davis, backed into a spot, I asked him, “What do they call that color?” He replied: “Glacier Blue. Matter of fact, Glacier Boy Blue. Print that!” McLaren, a British company, does offer the 720S in a shade called Glacier White but markets Gucci’s paint job under the name Fistral Blue, after a bay off the coast of Cornwall. Maybe he knew this and just didn’t care: Glacier is one of Gucci Mane’s favored slang terms for the enormous pieces of diamond jewelry he likes to wear, and he’d been teasing fans about a forthcoming project called “Glacier Boyz” — why miss an opportunity to plug it?Inside the studio, framed plaques commemorated platinum certifications for LPs recorded on the premises: Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours”; Britney Spears’s “Blackout.” No album by Gucci Mane, who has been putting out music since the early 2000s, has ever earned such a plaque, and yet his sprawling discography, consisting of some 100 albums and mixtapes, has helped make him a fringe legend with an outsize influence on hip-hop’s center. Drake, Nicki Minaj and Kanye West are among the stars he counts as fans and collaborators; Migos, Young Thug and 21 Savage are among the younger chart-toppers who owe him debts. “My flow,” Gucci Mane told me, “is the most copied flow in the world!”Gucci Mane is also a recovering drug addict, busy rebuilding a life he came close to destroying. He rapped recently about his dedication to swimming and meditating, arranged a live BET broadcast of his wedding — all-white dress code, 10-foot-tall cake encrusted with crystals, at least one ceremonial sword — to the lifestyle entrepreneur Keyshia Ka’oir and entered into a movie deal with Paramount tied to his best-selling “Autobiography of Gucci Mane.” On Twitter, having admired the motivational writing — and, no doubt, the lucrative hustle — of Deepak Chopra and Tony Robbins, he assumes the voice of a life coach: “It’s not too late to be great!” “Let’s rebuild the world!” Also: “I’m a GOD!”This is a different Gucci Mane from the one who rose to prominence a decade ago. A series of assault and weapons- and drug-possession convictions put him behind bars for years at a time; he lost his major-label contract with Atlantic. In Gucci Mane’s telling, the main cause of his troubles was the woozy cocktail of soda and promethazine-codeine cough syrup known as “lean.” It made him violently paranoid, constipated him severely and, nonetheless, became “something I required to operate.” In a strange way, his addiction was inextricable from his appeal. He created mixtapes high, offsetting grimy drug-dealing vignettes and brags of sexual domination with virtuosic wordplay and off-kilter humor. He went on engrossingly candid, unabashedly nasty Twitter tirades. In 2011, he tattooed his face with a triple-scoop ice cream cone topped with lightning bolts — a move that, in its combination of whimsy and possible derangement, inspired a queasy titillation in fans uncertain whether to be concerned or delighted.Given all this, Gucci’s present-day wholesomeness stands as one of the most improbable reinventions in hip-hop history. One thing that old Gucci and rehabilitated Gucci share, though, is a feverish productivity; in the last year and a half alone — re-signed to Atlantic — he has put out six albums. The latest is the excellent “El Gato: The Human Glacier,” which took him only two days to make, collaborating with the young producer Southside. “He’s in one room making beats, and I’m in another room recording,” Gucci said. The album is bracingly spare in its music and confrontational in its lyrics — an ambience established on “Rich Ass Junkie,” the opener, which revolves around a trippy, funereal electric-organ melody. “Rich ass junkie, rich ass junkie,” Gucci chants, first identifying himself, then identifying his clientele: “Riding around the city serving rich ass junkies.”Addicts commonly figure into hip-hop lyrics, but typically as objects, not subjects. Gucci led me into a recording room, sat beside a mixing board and recounted the song’s creation. “I was freestyling, and that’s when you say the realest things ever — no restraints. When I used to be in the hood sometimes, I’d be serving crack, and the crackhead would tell us, ‘Damn, y’all too high.’”I brought up the once-paradigmatic hip-hop figure of the unflappable hustler — never under the influence, always in control — epitomized by New York dealers-turned-rappers like Jay-Z and 50 Cent. “That’s the difference between New York and Down South,” Gucci replied. He mentioned Pimp C, the iconic Houston MC who died in his sleep after a lean overdose and whose 1992 song with UGK “Feel Like I’m the One Who’s Doin’ Dope” is a gory fantasia of debilitating drug use. He named other Southern rappers: “B.G. been talking about doing drugs. Juvenile. Soulja Slim. Geto Boys. It’s been going on, self-medication, and that’s the people I admired coming up, because they were talking about stuff you knew was authentic.”Gucci cites an aversion to “preachy” sentimentality, which isn’t the same as saying his music is without moral dimension. Last year he rapped about serving a pregnant woman in his adolescence: “feeding crack rock to a baby,” as he phrased it, “when you really just a baby.” He assured me that this story was true; ditto a related anecdote on “Rich Ass Junkie” in which he wonders about the ethics of selling to a heroin addict: “Dog food in her veins/’Cause I’m the one that’s serving her, am I the one to blame?” In an ad-lib, he hastily answers, “No!” but he told me that he doesn’t think the answer’s so simple: “I knew it was wrong, even then. It ain’t nothing you proud to do. But it was survival.”In his memoir, Gucci paints frequently unflattering self-portraits: betraying a benefactor’s trust; lying to his mother about his drug-dealing; serving time after a woman accused him, in 2011, of soliciting her for sex before shoving her from a moving car. (Gucci pleaded guilty to criminal charges but has disputed her account. In light of this episode, there remain aspects of his comeback-era persona that are impossible to blithely cheer on — as when, elsewhere on “El Gato,” he centers an entire chorus on a coercive if absurdist act of oral sex so extreme it results in “strep throat.”) I asked him if he wrote his book, in part, to unburden himself of long-held guilt. He frowned, searching for a different way to put it. “I used to hide so many things I’d done, because I was scared I was gonna go to jail. When I walked out the feds in 2016, I was like, I’m not doing that dance anymore.”“Rich Ass Junkie” is, in an understated way, a document of that kind of grappling. Gucci acknowledged that before his last prison stint, “I never would have done a song like ‘Rich Ass Junkie’” — a song, that is, identifying himself outright as a fiend. He told me: “Jail made me accept that I’m not the toothless junkie, but I’m still locked up. Might never get out because of things I did. That’s a failure, not a success.” He excused himself and made for a vocal booth. He would not tell me what he’d come to work on, saying only, “I’m here to make some money.” On my way out, I passed his 720S, glowing Glacier Boy Blue in the sunlight. ?Jonah Weiner is a contributing writer for the magazine.Videographer: Kenny Suleimanagich.

The deep consolation of a song about what it would feel like to die.By HANIF ABDURRAQIBFor a brief time, I lived near a black gospel church on the southeast side of Columbus, Ohio. When I say I lived near it, I mean that I lived above it, and this is how I knew that it was a black gospel church. I would be awakened on Sunday mornings by a uniform trembling of the floor — the kind that comes only when people clap their hands in unison or stomp their feet in a chorus of sound, when the wave of praise hits every spirit at once and has to find a way out. My mattress was on the floor, and I was sometimes sprawled across it diagonally or sometimes sprawled across it with my clothes from the night before still on. When the floor trembles with something holy and the vibrations rise into a body that is unholy, it is easy to convince yourself that you are being saved.“Claws in Your Back,” a song by Julien Baker, entered me the same way the vibrations from the church I lived above entered me, making me feel whole in a way I didn’t know I needed to. The song anchors Baker’s 2017 album, “Turn Out The Lights,” a slow meditation on darkness peppered with small spots of triumph. Baker is a 22-year-old singer from Memphis who grew up in the church. She still believes in God (she has a tattoo across her wrists that says “Dios Existe”), but she paints God as a complicated figure in a complicated life. Baker is openly gay, and inside her work is a tension between belief and doubt — the joy of praise and the sometimes plain sadness of living. There’s a refreshing lack of shame in her music.In “Claws in Your Back,” Baker talks about the idea of suicide as an invisible, but always hovering, animal: “So try to stay calm, ’cause nobody knows/The violent partner you carry around/With claws in your back, ripping your clothes/And listing your failures out loud.” At the end of the song’s first verse, she sings, “I’m conducting an experiment on how it feels to die,” and then there is a full seven-second beat before she concludes the thought: “or stay alive.” That interval of silence defines the stakes for the song: She is fighting through whatever is holding her underwater, grappling with the choice of whether to stay in this world or leave it.Baker sounds as if she believes she is singing to a higher power that might actually answer her back. Her voice pulls the stars down and makes you think they are each named for a moment you cherished but thought you would never touch again. There was a time, when I was growing up, when contemporary Christian music relied on thinly vague sentiments to find a home on the popular charts. Bands like Lifehouse wrote love songs to a God who could also be a wife who could also be a mother. The God in Julien Baker’s songs is God, very plainly. But she is trying to stretch the possibilities of what that can mean.If we are to believe that faith is a choice and love is a choice and somewhere in between is the rigor of staying alive when you don’t have the will to, then Baker is one of the best nontraditional gospel singers of her generation. It is the tension at the root of this song — at the root of so many of her songs — that acts as the church she is praying in. Religion can be freedom, but it can also be a haunting, or a trauma. It is one thing to say, “I believe in God,” and it is another to say, “I believe in God, and that doesn’t stop me from looking for exits some days.” “Claws in Your Back” is triumphant because it rests on a choice: Baker deciding she wants to stick around after all, but not before tracking through all of the reasons she might not. She is uninterested in the burying of pain for the sake of universal uplift. The uplift is simply the survival of pain, which isn’t promised.The best love songs to God are the ones that divide the idea of God into whatever listeners think they can digest. I believe in God sometimes, but I believe in God the most when I imagine a God who has my mother’s laugh. I believe in a God who doesn’t want to get out of bed some mornings. A God who holds the old leather jackets of her dead friends and sits in a pile of old records on the floor of whatever heaven looks like. I believe in a God who comes home after a long night of being less than holy and sprawls out in a bed wearing the same clothes he went out in, and I believe in a God who is jarred awake by the floor rumbling with the weight of people praising his name. A wall of many hands clapping because of what his presence moved them to do.I once saw Baker sing a song called “Rejoice” live, in a room in Tennessee that was packed with people silently receiving the song. They breathed in the notes with what seemed like one breath, while Baker stood onstage, barely moving, but for her fingers along the strings of her guitar, her head down and her hair over her eyes. The performance ended with her pushing the limits of her voice to sing the word “rejoice” over and over again, bending it beyond its inclination toward a type of gospel-driven deliverance and making the word a door that everyone could walk through and feel clean. It’s the kind of word that — when sung by the right person in the right room — can make the work of staying alive not feel like work at all. ?Hanif Abdurraqib is a poet, an essayist and a cultural critic from Ohio.Photograph by Eva O’Leary for The New York Times.Correction: March 14, 2018.

He had already spent the better part of a decade producing his own music as DJ Taye, much of it under the tutelage of DJs Rashad and Spinn, leading figures in Chicago’s footwork scene. Footwork is both a style of dancing and the hyperadrenalized electronic music that goes with it, a rush of tangling rhythms and alien synth tones; it’s a true Chicago creation, born of South Side roller rinks, house parties and black teenage ingenuity.Rashad, back then, was about to release an album that would help take that music far beyond its home turf, spearheading a whole crossover moment. He and Spinn were playing high-profile festivals and tours; Vice was releasing documentaries about footwork dance crews; it was starting to seem like necessary listening for anyone in search of electronic music’s cutting edge. When Rashad’s “Double Cup” came out in 2013, the album’s cover was an aerial view of the city itself, Chicago’s orange streetlights illuminating its sprawling grid. Footwork looked like a way up.Only six months after “Double Cup” was released, though, Rashad was found dead from an accidental overdose on the city’s West Side. Taye had left school by then; he’d spent time working in a stockroom and was DJing around the area. At the same time, Hyperdub, the British label that released “Double Cup,” was beginning to ask Taye for more tracks — and, eventually, a full album. It was Rashad who had connected Taye with the label in the first place. “It felt meaningful,” Taye says. “I would call it bittersweet now.” It felt like a door opening: “There it is — but how hard can you walk through it? Because there’s no going back.”Taye grew up in Harvey, Ill., a suburb some 20 miles south of Chicago’s downtown Loop. He first encountered footwork as a style of dancing in third or fourth grade; a few years later, he and a friend found an unlabeled CD of footwork music and were struck by what he calls “the rawness and ruggedness of it.” It sent him digging for more music online, and by junior high he was making his own, using a free version of the FruityLoops production software and his great-grandmother’s computer. He was 16 when he met Rashad and Spinn at a dance battle and only slightly older when he joined the ranks of their Teklife crew — still too young to even get into the clubs where the pair would DJ. But he remembers noticing that footwork was frequently taking the two of them to London, far from the South Side where they all grew up.In the years since Rashad’s death, some of that big wave of global interest in footwork has receded. Rashad had set his sights on something grand and accessible, tempering footwork’s frenzy with the sound of R.&B., making it more legible to new audiences — but there was, initially, no apparent heir to those ambitions. Beyond Rashad was a labyrinthine scene that aimed its music in a lot of different directions but rarely tried to court the uninitiated at the club.Except, perhaps, for Taye, who felt — still feels — an obligation to fulfill Rashad’s unrealized goal of bringing Chicago to the world. “This is what I have to do,” he says. “I feel like so many things are telling me this is what I have to do. All paths lead to it.” On the 23-year-old’s debut album, “Still Trippin’,” released this month, the ambition is palpable. “There is a gap,” he says, “between footwork and some of Chicago’s rappers being the biggest rappers in the world.” The album’s first single, “Trippin’,” is an attempt to bridge that gap, using Taye’s voice to build one of the finest pop propositions that footwork has yet created — and, he says, to “keep the elevation going” and “do what Rashad was pushing for.”Writing and producing the record took Taye more than two years. There were sessions in New York, Berlin and Dallas and months spent in Los Angeles after Taye found himself “going through some things” in his own neighborhood. But the album was ultimately assembled back in Harvey, with Taye cloistered in his childhood bedroom-turned-studio, adjacent to the kitchen, from which his Tupac-loving mother could hear the music taking shape. The result is potent, slippery and hypnotic — and the seamless infusion of hip-hop Taye has brought to it really does have the potential to open footwork up to a bigger audience than it has ever courted before. His aims are lofty ones. But there are only three people, he says, whose opinions of his music have ever truly mattered to him: “Rashad, Spinn and my mom.” ?Jessica Hopper is a Chicago-based music critic and author. Her memoir, “Night Moves,” will be published this fall.A Latin crossover hit is a paean to pot and more.By JULIANNE ESCOBEDO SHEPHERDTrap music, a bassy, triple-time variant of rap, produces endless smoking anthems, ardent paeans to procuring and enjoying herb and the lifestyle that surrounds it. “Krippy Kush,” named after a particularly superior strain of cannabis, is a statement single from the reggaetonero-turned-trap-artist Farruko that rides on a hook from the mischievous 24-year-old Puerto Rican star Bad Bunny. It’s a blast in this genre of hazy joy, a Spanish-language expression of an inalienable right to high-grade weed that smuggles in a deeper message.Bad Bunny’s charms are considerable. His chorus comes across in hypnotic technicolor — “Los maliantes quieren krippy, krippy krippy krippy” (“The gangsters want krippy, krippy, krippy”) — purring the word “krippy” and then whooping the word “kush.” In the original video, released in August, Bad Bunny crouched atop the counter of a Florida bagel joint wearing a canary-yellow jacket, magnetically rapping while nursing a lollipop. Farruko, equally lively in slime-green braids and a button-down resembling a vintage Trapper Keeper, added his verse while riding in a Jeep packed with women. The song embraces a sort of lawlessness-light, with braggy chatter about importing pot via such conventional means as FedEx — the shipping charged to Farruko’s love’s ex, a cost-saving stunt.But unlike the early era of Snoop Dogg or the later one of Wiz Khalifa — each of whom Bad Bunny name-checks in his verse — rapping about herb-smoking is not as renegade as it once was. Recreational use has been legalized across the West Coast, as well as in Alaska, Colorado, Maine and Massachusetts. In Puerto Rico, medical marijuana was formally legalized last July, a shift Bad Bunny commemorates by boasting that he signed the law himself.The song’s adherence to its weed-rap lineage reveals something about how young Latin musicians relate to their peers who rap in English — and how they influence them. When the mainlanders 21 Savage, Travis Scott and Nicki Minaj appeared on the “Krippy Kush” remix, it was part of a larger trend of the so-called mainstream recognizing a hit Latin track — the musical and cultural story that, after the ubiquitous hit “Despacito,” defined Latin crossover in 2017. But it also showed a disconnect between English-speaking listeners (who are increasingly used to hearing Spanish on the radio) and the music industry that serves them (which can’t seem to accept its Latin counterpart as an inextricable part of itself). That “Despacito” lost all three of the Grammys it was nominated for — but won four at the separate-and-not-so-equal Latin Grammys, including Record and Song of the Year — is evidence of the depth of that disconnect.Farruko and Bad Bunny are influenced by mainland acts like Migos and Rae Sremmurd, but they also draw from — and aspire to — a bigger stage. As young Spanish-speaking artists have shown countless times, internet platforms are a good way to circumvent the American mainstream altogether and aim instead for the world. On that level, “Krippy Kush” is about something far larger than getting faded. Its purveyors may be kooky-eyed off blunts — “Dos Phillies, se queda bizca” (“Two Phillies and she’s cross-eyed”), as Bad Bunny puts it — but their flamboyant self-sufficiency is as cleareyed as can be. ?Julianne Escobedo Shepherd is the deputy editor at Jezebel.We’re all most ourselves in our fantasies.By BRIAN HOWEThere was a moment, somewhere in the middle of the 1990s, when people thought new technology was transforming music, totally and completely. The whole concept of genre, they said, was finished, shattered to pieces by samplers and the clever postmodern collage artists who used them. Of course, they had absolutely no idea what was coming. It wasn’t boundary-crossing musicians who would wind up blowing pop to bits. It was the internet and the MP3 and, eventually, the streaming-audio platform — those were the developments that would, just a few years later, explode everything into infinite constellations of code and sound, with peculiar and vertiginous results.One of the most singular of those results is a 23-year-old named Archy Marshall, the London singer and guitarist who has, over the last decade, risen to modest success and immodest acclaim as King Krule. This disproportion is understandable; his music is both exceedingly good and exceedingly strange. Marshall is part of an age cohort that grew up with no memory of a musical monoculture, or a world in which powerful record labels made sure that everything fit into a marketable cultural slot. The very idea of “collage” — the self-conscious blending of disparate things — means little to them, because they have so little reason to see things as disparate in the first place. The music that streams endlessly in their direction is organized not by a record store’s genre-filing system but by recommendation algorithms, those strange, roving intelligences that both shape and are shaped by tastes, gradually building digital dossiers on each user’s unique aesthetics.And this is the context that explains how King Krule’s music can sound so old yet feel so young. Marshall is a graffiti-writing city kid who cultivates the air of a squalid lounge singer in some forgotten marble lobby. He’s a guitar prodigy who barely touches his guitar, an electronic-music nodder who’s handy with jazz melody, a lo-fi punk who loves clean guitar sounds and frilly horns. It’s as if an endless playlist loaded with clashing search terms malfunctioned, melted and turned into a real boy. Even his singing voice seems incongruous — a low, coarse jumble of croaks and mumbles and croons, all coming from a slight-framed, flame-haired kid.He really was a kid when he got started: a 15-year-old, but one who seemed beamed in from another planet. Nothing he did on his 2010 breakthrough single, “Out Getting Ribs,” was particularly or intentionally otherworldly — the whole thing was basically just his voice and an electric guitar — and yet it sounded deeply esoteric, as if it had emerged from some secret place or time nobody else was aware of. He released it using the name Zoo Kid, and the song appeared again in 2013 on the saturnine “6 Feet Beneath the Moon,” Marshall’s first full-length album, released under the name King Krule when he was 19. “The Ooz,” as sprawling as that debut was spare, followed last year. In its shaggy opening song, “Biscuit Town,” Marshall rhymes “Coca-Cola,” “Ebola” and “bipolar,” which is a pretty good summary of his conceptual terrain — the sweet and the sick all awkwardly fogged together. The album sprawls, and he fixates on decline, depredation and depression. Wherever Biscuit Town is, it clearly occupies the same world as “Logos,” in which Marshall, over a cool-jazz snap, describes vistas of urban decay: “The bookie’s shut, all bets are blown/The license bust, the shops are closed/I caught my mum, she stumbles home/Through open ground, back to broken homes.”Even the album’s most intelligible songs, like “Dum Surfer,” obey the same mystifying rubric — they seem not so much flexible with categories as oblivious to them. Try to imagine a crowd this song might be addressed to, and you may wind up picturing a cartoon mix of zoot-suited jazz goons, mod rockers, brawling punks, rap backpackers and track-suited soccer hooligans; the whole thing seems to belong in some invented space like the roadhouse from “Twin Peaks,” where bikers and loggers gathered, for some reason, to listen to dreamy art-pop. This is the single, the one he’s trotting out for late-night TV appearances. The world he creates is flagrantly ersatz, all inside his head. But that’s part of why it feels so pungently real: We’re all most individual, most ourselves, in our fantasies.It used to be that musicians would combine different ideas deliberately and self-consciously, making music they knew we’d celebrate as intriguingly eclectic. But Marshall seems like an early representative of a fundamentally different tradition: It’s less as if he has chosen a wild combination of styles and ideas and more as if he has just bodied one forth, as if it existed all along and he simply found it. It’s someplace dark and subterranean, where everything sheds its cultural pedigree and blurs together in a private world beyond common references.Marshall says he has been influenced by everyone from Chet Baker and Dirty Beaches to the 1930s arranger and composer Einar Aaron Swan, but a recommendation engine’s insensate variety, its undifferentiated choice — that might be his tribe’s signal influence. This, after all, is what every streaming platform and music-recommendation engine is trying to accomplish: to personalize categories ever more finely, parsing and curating and homing in on our tastes until, eventually, we have each become a genre of one. ?Brian Howe is an editor at Indy Week and a writer for Pitchfork and Spin.

It would be reasonable to ask: The band is practically unknown, and the song’s distorted lyrics bear the syntactic markings of English as a second language. Perhaps as a result, they are banal to the point of self-parody: “There’s nobody like my mom/There’s no place like my home since I was born.” And yet, the first time I heard it, before the track was finished, I was fighting back tears.That’s because the 5-minute-37-second video accompanying the minimal ode to the euphoria of homecoming is another experience entirely. Mainstream pop acts no longer need music videos to generate buzz, but the Blaze, comprising the cousins Guillaume and Jonathan Alric, 35 and 28 respectively, are also talented filmmakers, and they have deliberately tailored their musical production toward ambitious, provocative visual shorts. In January 2016, they notched a breakout success with the video for their debut single, “Virile,” a sparse depiction of a night of substance-fuelled revelry between two men, apparently of North African descent, that is provocative for the emotional sensitivity and homoerotic frisson it so matter-of-factly transmits. The two men, who present as conventionally macho and straight, smoke, dance, rap, slap-box and embrace with a joyful intensity that is infectious and in no way presaged by the lyrics that occasion it. Thirteen months later, the Alrics uploaded “Territory” to YouTube, and the video blasted off from where “Virile” had landed. The viral success of the clip, as well as plaudits from on high — the director of “Moonlight,” Barry Jenkins, described it on Twitter as “THE best piece of art I’ve seen in 2017” — is a reminder that the medium is simultaneously anachronistic and as timelessly urgent as the need to tell stories itself.Like “Virile,” the song can hold its own — conjuring a dolorous-yet-warm four-to-the-floor rhythm embellished by sharp, surgical synths — but it’s inextricable, to an unusual degree, from the visual narrative that animates it. The video doesn’t just complement the lyrical content so much as stand in for it, filling in the layers of ambiguity and feeling the song can only crudely sketch. “Territory” tells the story of a young man (perhaps a boxer) who has crossed the Mediterranean (almost certainly from France) to rejoin his family in Algiers for (what seems to be) a funeral. There is no dialogue or subtitles; everything the viewer comes to understand is conveyed with marvelous economy through the body — longing and contented glances, sorrowful and exuberant tears, bear hugs, feverish dancing, shadowboxing, hookah-smoking, furious sprinting across the beach.The plot emerges over repeat viewings: the young man’s family, spanning four generations, sleeping together in a single room; the young man sitting on a rooftop with five others as they prostrate themselves in prayer — he stays off to the side as the sun rises over their backs, his absence having changed him; a hallucinatory finale where his open-air workout morphs into a gorilla dance that at once terrifies and delights his relatives looking on. As a display, it is also terribly fragile, evocative of the predicament of the protagonist, whose status as an immigrant marks him as barbaric — racaille — over there, and yet his time in the West has led him, paradoxically, to play up this imposed thuggishness when he’s back home. In either place, it seems, he is doomed to be a foreigner. And so a demand for recognition in the deepest Hegelian sense emerges through this knuckle-dragging prance — an awesome act of desperation that ends with a literal thumping of the chest.If they are depicted at all, young men from the Arab world tend to be drawn through a reductive set of assumptions. The Alrics — not North African themselves — did something rare indeed, but something that the best art must always do: render the “other,” in all his eccentric specificity, universally knowable. I can’t count the number of op-eds and reports I’ve read about the challenges confronting immigrants in Europe, but I know I’ve rarely been moved like this. “Territory” is revelatory — doubly so because it still manages to make you want to dance. ?Thomas Chatterton Williams is a contributing writer for the magazine.Pop’s resident Sad Girl considers hope.By CHELSEA HODSONSince the beginning of Lana Del Rey’s career, we’ve listened to her lust after fast cars, “money, power, glory” and older men — the archetypal rich, powerful kind we expect to find in troubling headlines. A lyric from 2012 sure sounds like “Harvey’s in the sky with diamonds,” and while it went down on the lyric sheet without the name, she recently told MTV that she’d had a “Harvey Weinstein/Harry Winston type of character in mind.” She created a character for herself as well: a midcentury Hollywood lounge singer who has been sent to the future to show us the meaning of sadness, as if it were a lesson that could be learned. In her melancholy world, to love is to live, so to love the wrong person is to be “born to die.” In 2014’s “Ultraviolence,” three years after Beyoncé sang about girls running the world, Del Rey was borrowing the infamous lyric in a Crystals song from 1962 — “He hit me and it felt like a kiss ” — before rhyming “sirens” with “violins,” mixing up pain and beauty, letting one become the other. As with the Harvey line, she no longer sings the “he hit me” part.Can women still be “good” feminists if they are willing to ride along with this romanticized violence? Del Rey always seemed uninterested in that question. She often surrounded herself with American flags, as though anchoring her persona in a tradition of national icons; she said in interviews that she worshiped Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. If self-destruction was her favorite muse, America was her favorite backdrop. In the video for 2012’s “Ride,” she wrapped the flag around her shoulders, hoisted it above her head and then rode off on the back of a man’s motorcycle. She went wherever her men went, proudly waving the flag of her own submission.But on her 2017 album, “Lust for Life,” there’s something different. Del Rey’s old album covers featured her trademark sad-girl pout; on this one, the woman who once told The Guardian that “I wish I was dead already” was smiling into the camera, flowers in her hair. And on the album’s second-to-last song, “Change,” some of that fatalism seems to be melting away. “There’s somethin’ in the wind, I can feel it blowin’ in,” she begins. “It’s comin’ in softly on the wings of a bomb.” And, later: “Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin’ in me.” She has always had a tendency to lean on those who came before her, and now she’s not-so-subtly pointing to Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind” and Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come.” Yes, she takes a moment to doubt herself (“Lately, I’ve been thinkin’ it’s just someone else’s job to care”), and we still see everything through the romantic tint of her glasses, the bomb arriving “softly” and with wings. Still: She sees something coming.Maybe it’s just that lately it has gone out of fashion to view violence, fatalism and apolitical ennui with any sort of affection. Before anyone could blame her for refusing to engage, Del Rey began to write songs that acknowledged the present. She even told Pitchfork that she was retiring her American flag visuals on tour in the era of Trump: “I’d rather have static.” In “Change,” she ponders the possibility that personal evolution could be a political move, her lyrics switching from speaking for herself (“I’ll be able to be honest, capable”) to, perhaps, speaking for everyone: “There’s a change gonna come, I don’t know where or when/But whenever it does, we’ll be here for it.” She becomes, in essence, an extremely unlikely protest songwriter — not exactly calling anyone to arms, but trying to understand something, however haltingly, about how transformation begins. ?Chelsea Hodson is the author of a soon-to-be-published book of essays, “Tonight I’m Someone Else.” She teaches writing at Catapult in New York.Photo by Rich Fury/Invision, via Associated PressAn exercise in ruthlessness, a heaping of drama.By MOLLY LAMBERTOn shows like “The Voice” or “American Idol,” stardom is presented as a meritocracy that a panel of judges identify. On a 2012 episode of “The X Factor,” Simon Cowell, Demi Lovato, Britney Spears and the record producer L.A. Reid selected five solo contestants who had failed to impress them on their singular merit and forced them into the open girl-group spot in American pop music, and they eventually called it Fifth Harmony.Historically, the interpersonal dynamics of girl groups are marked by public-facing sisterhood and a war for power behind the scenes. In Fifth Harmony, the contractual unity never felt fully believable: Each woman sang her parts as if she were trying to sing her way out of the group. Most of the members stuck with the glossy vocal runs of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, the style that characterizes most successful reality-show singing, but Camila Cabello’s nasal voice and vocal contortions stuck out like a weird thumb. Cabello, the ensemble’s 21-year-old wild card, made almost inexplicable vocal choices, more in tune with the mannerisms of singers like Halsey or Lorde than with her group members. When she stepped out with a feature on Machine Gun Kelly’s bizarre, Bonnie-and-Clyde themed “Bad Things” and it became a hit, it seemed easy enough for her to leave the group. The beleaguered foursome’s 2017 MTV Video Music Awards performance featured a decoy quite obviously intended to be Cabello, who flung herself off the stage. They still go by Fifth Harmony.If there are two things pop music — and reality-show competitions and Simon Cowell, too — demand, it’s individuality and ruthlessness. On “Havana” — not far from where Cabello was born — she finally acts out without her peers being in the way: She favors theatrical flourishes like death drops from her head voice to her lower register, full of vocal fry. Unlike in Fifth Harmony, her voice wiggles in through the front door of “Havana,” extending a leg up on the honky-tonk piano in order to expertly ride a beat built around a Westworldian riff and an Afro-Cuban rhythm.If “Havana” proves anything, it’s that you don’t necessarily need talent to make it big; you just need a lot of ambition and a certain ruthlessness. You have to be willing to cut your squad. It’s the kind of fun and frothy pop-culture breakup that satisfies a thirst for drama without serious consequences. ?Molly Lambert is a Talk columnist for the magazine.Photograph by Natalia MantiniThe darkside of teendom.By DIAMOND SHARPBillie Eilish doesn’t like to smile. “I like to be in control of how I look and how I feel and how I act,” the 16-year-old Los Angeles native once told Billboard, “and the obligation is to smile back at someone if they smile at you.” Listening to “dont smile at me,” her debut EP, feels like stumbling down a rabbit hole of delectable rage.Eilish, a singer and songwriter with a perennially stern expression and silver hair, insists on thwarting the feminine pleasantries typically demanded of teenage girls. I first discovered her after listening to her viral 2015 single, “Ocean Eyes,” which she originally uploaded to SoundCloud as a class project. Soon, the track, produced by her brother, amassed over three million listens.Her first album feels otherworldly: solidly electro-pop, her gentle voice juxtaposed with dark lyrics. The upbeat “Bellyache” — written from the perspective of a satisfied killer — starts out sweet, with Eilish reverberating over a whimsical beat and conjuring a classic image of disaffected teendom: “Sittin’ all alone/Mouth full of gum/In the driveway.” But then she vacillates between the emotional carnage of teenage girlhood and actual bloodshed, turning typical victim-and-murderer tropes on their heads. It’s not hard to imagine Eilish smirking as she sings through the grisliness: “My friends aren’t far/In the back of my car/Lay their bodies.” The video for the song portrays her as a road-tripping Little Red Riding Hood, the vermilion cloak now acid yellow. She’s lost — or running away — on a strip of empty road instead of the woods, herself the murderous wolf.Our culture demands that young girls crave validation, but Eilish and her cast of characters feel no such thing. There are no apologies in her songs about the disappointments of love — only poetic quips about potential lovers tripping over knives or the subject of a song remorselessly burning the car of an ex-flame. Her music feels familiar — who hasn’t felt teenage angst and melancholia? — but she doesn’t easily fit into any of the predefined categories for teenage artists: bubble-gum pop, emo, love-obsessed chanteuse.Eilish’s most obvious peer is Lorde, another young woman who controlled the reins of her artistic vision at a young age. Both are interested in verisimilitude: Girlhood doesn’t necessarily mean sunshine or heart emojis or sugar-sweet music. (And Eilish’s approach, however familiar, works; her coming North American tour sold out in an hour.)When I was a teenager, I didn’t lean into my inclination for melancholia and anger — I was too afraid of how others viewed me. I never kept diaries, because I was afraid of their being found and my innermost thoughts being uncovered. I wish I had come across music like this, that held anger and adolescence in the same hand: It might’ve made me feel better, even if just for a few minutes. ?Diamond Sharp is a writer and poet from Chicago.A new generation of rappers has learned to thrive where Big Pharma meets Silicon Valley.By CHARLES AARONA woozy, stop-start rat-a-tat of idle, context-free rap chatter “Flex Like Ouu” is catchy in the same way that toddlers are adorable even when they throw up on your shirt.

Gazzy Garcia — an elfin, 17-year-old South Florida rapper with pink dreads and braces — has recorded more popular songs, including the No. 3 pop smash “Gucci Gang,” which was spoofed twice on “Saturday Night Live.” But “Flex Like Ouu” better captures Pump’s ephemeral charisma. It also embodies the scene that spawned him — the mind-numbed, infinitely boyish D.I.Y. rap movement most often referred to as “SoundCloud rap,” for the popular audiostreaming platform that gave it life.This is how we find stars now: by trawling online. Pump is a viral gremlin, spouting his catchphrase “ESSSKEDDDAAAAT!” (“Let’s get it!”) in whatever virtual space you find him. You can see him on Instagram staring blankly from a series of hotel rooms, wearing a Versace bathrobe over his Gucci chest tattoo; or on YouTube, seemingly firing a gun out of a parked car’s window; or bragging about his expensive gear to an unimpressed older woman in a hotel hallway; or reminiscing, in overblown language that practically begs for a polygraph, about punching a girl in seventh grade because she threw gum in his hair. In this way, his origin story is similar to his fellow SoundCloud hooligans XXXTentacion (who created an early buzz with YouTube videos of himself getting in fights) and Tekashi 6ix9ine (who tantalized fashion blogs with his provocative, customized clothing).Beyond this click-bait buffoonery, the music of Lil Pump and his fellow SoundCloud rappers is overwhelmingly defined by exhibitionistic, exorbitant self-medication. The scene has branded itself, inadvertently or not, as a space where kids can loudly boast about their irresponsible consumption of (mostly) prescription drugs. These substances can be divided into two main categories: 1) benzodiazepines, a.k.a. benzos, synthetic anxiety medications like Valium, Klonopin, Ativan or, most of all, Xanax, which has become as linked to the scene as heroin was with grunge; and 2) opioids, painkillers like Percocet, Vicodin, oxycodone, OxyContin, Roxicodone, prescription-grade codeine cough syrup and fentanyl, a powerful synthetic that is often used to re-invigorate stepped-on heroin.The SoundCloud rap wave has become synonymous with substance abuse primarily because it is peopled by an optimal demographic for experimentation — young, male, often rootless or from dysfunctional families, lacking impulse control, novelty-seeking, attention-thirsty, susceptible to peer pressure. “They’re from the Pill Generation,” says Dr. Anna Lembke, chief of the Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University’s School of Medicine. Their age cohort has been prescribed behavior- and mood-regulating drugs from an early age. “It’s not a big deal for them to be, like, ‘Oh, this chemical changes the way you feel for the better, sure.’” Xanax is particularly mythologized, she says, because it’s so effective: It “rapidly takes away anxiety, takes away your worries, your future catastrophizing, your sense of consequences.”The once-fringe scene’s absorption into pop culture has been almost instantaneous. Over the last two years, rappers who had been considered internet nuisances have become major-label artists, with responsibilities to match: recording, touring, adhering to a schedule. Xanax might seem to help with the pressure, but when taken excessively, or in combination with other drugs, the results can be tragic. Last November, Lil Peep, a.k.a. Gustav Ahr, the scene’s Kurt Cobain-esque pop hopeful — white, handsome, with a preternatural melodic gift — was found dead on his tour bus in Arizona, from an accidental overdose of Xanax and fentanyl. Traces of cocaine, marijuana and several different opioids were also reportedly found in his system.As “XO Tour Llif3,” by the SoundCloud-adjacent rapper Lil Uzi Vert, haunted the pop charts last summer — “I might blow my brain out,” he rap-croons, “please, Xanny, make it go away” — the scene’s co-dependent relationship with drugs was in flux. In September, the Atlanta-based rapper Russ posted a photo of himself on Twitter wearing a T-shirt that read, “HOW MUCH XANS AND LEAN DO YOU HAVE TO DO BEFORE YOU REALIZE YOU’RE A [EXPLETIVE] LOSER.” The influential Chicago-born rapper Fredo Santana replied, “Until I can stop thinking bout my dead homies an the trauma that I been thru in my life that’s when I’ll stop.” On Jan. 19, Fredo Santana died in his California home from a seizure, after being hospitalized for liver and kidney failure believed to have been caused by his long-term addiction to codeine syrup. He was 27 years old.After Pump signed to Warner Brothers Records last year, at 17, it was reported that his management company and label planned a party at a Los Angeles strip club where he was presented with a cake in the shape of a giant white Xanax tablet. Pump once tweeted “Xanax is the wave” and captioned an Instagram photo of himself holding a stack of bills with the line, “Pop a Xan & get rich.” But by New Year’s Day, Pump made a resolution on Instagram: “btw I don’t take Xanax no more.” In February, a TMZ video caught him leaving a juvenile detention center, reportedly after firing a handgun through the front door of the Los Angeles home he shares with his mother; Pump shouted, “ESSSKEDDDAAAAT” and rapped about popping Xans “in the past tense.” At a recent show, a rapper who goes by — no joke — Lil Xan felt compelled to formally renounce the drug. He also clarified that his “Xanarchy” fan club was, in fact, anti-Xanax and said that he would change his stage name.All this called to mind two moments from “The Last Waltz,” Martin Scorsese’s drug-weary film memorializing the Band’s 1976 farewell live performance. The first involved Neil Young playing a keening version of “Helpless” with a hunk of cocaine lodged in his left nostril; the second was an interlude in which a drained Robbie Robertson explains his career as a touring musician. “The road was our school, our sense of survival,” he says: “It taught us all we know.” But, he adds, “you can press your luck. It’s a goddamn impossible way of life. “These are the polar extremes at which musicians — and so many young people — tend to exist, in a hyperreal world of exalted risk-taking and self-mythologized fatalism that those of us at home envy, mock and consume. That’s why the SoundCloud rap scene can be so jarring to adult outsiders. It’s “The Last Waltz” gone virtual slapstick, full of bleary boys pratfalling to create an identity that can voyeuristically amuse us, at least in short bursts. (“Flex Like Ouu” runs 1:48.) They are test cases of what happens when a kid is fully immersed in the most severely volatile setting, right at the intersection of Big Pharma and Silicon Valley. This seemingly D.I.Y. world has been instantly powdered into a product that can be swallowed, when needed, to keep the now-corporate spectacle aglow. In a sense, the artists themselves have become the drugs. ?Charles Aaron is a writer and an editor who has written extensively about self-medication and music.Photograph by Jerritt Clark/Getty Images.The allure of a real-life partnership set to music.By JUDY BERMANMusician couples make voyeurs of us all. We’ve watched Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s romance unfold in chapters, from the giddy courtship immortalized on their early duet “Crazy in Love” to the new parents’ kitchen tryst in a sequel, “Drunk in Love,” to the separate albums of adultery and reconciliation, “Lemonade” and “4:44.” Forty years ago, it was the back story as much as the hits that made Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours” a classic — two couples unraveling in the studio while the fifth wheel confronts his wife’s infidelity. Combine the extremes of passion or heartbreak with fans’ hunger for insight into the love lives of artists and celebrities, and a piece of music can wind up endowed with almost mythical power.“Alan,” the song that ends “No Shape,” Mike Hadreas’s fourth album as Perfume Genius, is quieter but no less personal. Named for Alan Wyffels, Hadreas’s boyfriend and keyboardist for most of a decade, it is a vignette of domestic bliss. The couple met in A.A., and their partnership sustained them through recovery, through sobriety, through the rise of Perfume Genius. Their life together has stabilized enough for Hadreas to glance at the man dozing beside him and marvel, as he does on “Alan,” that “We sleep through the night.”Hadreas has always been forthright about sexuality, both in his persona and in his songs. What’s new about “Alan” is its tranquillity. On Hadreas’s first three albums as Perfume Genius, queer pride and defiant effeminacy soothed the scars of homophobia; survival in a hostile world required daily reckonings with addiction, depression and disgust at what his own body had suffered. In 2012, YouTube banned a promotional clip for the album “Put Your Back N 2 It,” judging its shots of a hulking male porn star embracing the tiny Hadreas and applying makeup to the singer’s face to be “non family safe.” Perfume Genius returned two years later with the woozy glam single “Queen,” in which Hadreas boasts, “No family is safe/When I sashay.”“No Shape” has its audacious moments (“Die 4 You” is a slow jam about erotic asphyxiation), but its collage of tender ballads and glittering anthems leans toward resilience, not transgression. It’s the view from the other side of the rainbow, where Hadreas isn’t as worried about being alone or powerless. “Alan” is the pot of gold at the end of that arc. “It’s about how if he truly needed me I would be there, and that wasn’t always true of me,” Hadreas told The Guardian last May. “There are a lot of songs about youth and young love, especially in relation to gayness; I wanted to make sacred the other side of that.” He and Wyffels often perform side by side at an electric piano, in a gesture whose guileless intimacy can make pop’s heterosexual couples look like strangers by comparison. But Hadreas plays “Alan” solo, unfurling his voice like a banner as he muses, “I’m here/How weird.” It’s a fitting update, and perhaps a callback, to an older gay-liberation chant. Five decades after Stonewall, Mike Hadreas is here, how weird — and he’s the one who’s still getting used to it. ?Judy Berman is a writer and an editor in Brooklyn.Kieran Frost/Getty ImagesSongs that make the originals seem Ersatz.By JODY ROSENThe song first bustled into earshot late in 2016. A remix, featuring the rapper Cardi B, began its rise to the Top 5 of Billboard’s Hot 100 early in 2018. But sonically — spiritually — “Finesse” is pure 1989. Bruno Mars’s records are exercises in time travel, evoking pop’s past at a subatomic level, down to the most microscopic fillips and filigrees. In “Finesse,” he conjures the heyday of new jack swing, that period in the late 1980s and early ’90s when hip-hop and R.&B. first joined forces, and majestic topiary hi-top fades crowned the heads of a new generation of black stars. Full of clattering drum-machine rhythms, lurching synthesizers and close-harmony background vocals, “Finesse” calls to mind old hits like Bobby Brown’s “Don’t Be Cruel.” Its bass line resembles the one in Michael Jackson’s “Remember the Time”; Cardi B delivers her rhymes in cadences borrowed from Salt-N-Pepa and Heavy D. But Mars is not merely collaging together scraps. “Finesse” doesn’t just sound like a long-lost new jack swing classic; it sounds like the new jack swing Platonic ideal. It’s an imitation so fine-tuned it makes the originals seem ersatz.Nostalgia in pop music is usually polemical — a grumpy argument for the good ol’ over the bad new. But Mars is a nonideological revivalist. He neither worships the past nor scorns the present; nor is he ironic, a wise guy smirking at yesteryear’s kitsch. He regards the musical past with a fan’s affection and a connoisseur’s relish for minutiae. In “Finesse,” Mars’s mastery of detail extends to the lyrics, which revel in circa-1989 hip-hop hauteur. The chorus circles around a refrain, “We out here drippin’ in finesse/It don’t make no sense” — a period-perfect mixed metaphor, capped by a wink at its own goofiness.Mars brings this exacting ear to everything he records. “Uptown Funk,” his 2014 smash with Mark Ronson, channeled the Gap Band and the Time. Elsewhere he has resurrected suave 1970s disco-soul, jittery new-wave rock, even dub reggae. In concert, he offers another throwback, leading a band that navigates tight grooves and intricate choreography like a ’60s soul revue. He’s a nimble singer, dancer and multi-instrumentalist who has internalized decades of pop moves and mannerisms. He was to the mannerisms born. He began performing in his family’s band as a preschooler in Hawaii, gaining fame on the Waikiki showroom circuit as “The World’s Youngest Elvis Impersonator.” Mars’s genius for mimicry has made him a juggernaut. Since 2010, he has had seven No. 1 singles; seven others have reached the Top 5.Not everyone is a fan. When Mars swept the top prizes at the Grammy Awards in January, critics derided the results as music-biz conservatism. Justin Vernon, the singer-songwriter who records as Bon Iver, tweeted, “Mr Mars made a name in the INDUSTRY by making hits OUT of hits of yesteryear.” Mars’s old-fashioned musicianship is reassuring to industry graybeards who look at the Billboard charts and see “real music” under siege — Lil Uzi Vert aiming a catapult at the castle keep where Eric Clapton safeguards his Stratocasters.But Mars is more progressive than his detractors claim. Like Barack Obama, he’s a mixed-race kid from Hawaii, a product of that state’s heady postcolonial cultural mix; he resists default racial-musical categorization. His version of “classic,” meanwhile, reflects the simple truth that hip-hop-inflected R.&B. long ago replaced rock as popular music’s lingua franca. He’s a canon-reformer, inscribing names like Teddy Riley and TLC in the Great American Songbook alongside the demigods of earlier eras.Mars’s great sin, the transgression that brings disdain from some corners, is his insistence on fun above all. He’s content to lead the world’s greatest wedding band. His success shows that there is an appetite, in 2018, for ecumenical party anthems that inspire all-ages stampedes to the dance floor. “That’s What I Like,” Mars’s recent Song of the Year Grammy-winner, is modeled on early-’90s R. Kelly, but Mars sneaks in sputtering trap beats: a nod to the kids.As for older fans, they constitute a boom market. Two generations reared on rap have slouched into middle age. One of America’s most popular new radio formats is Oldies Hip-Hop. Those listeners must have appreciated Mars’s rendition of “Finesse” at the Grammys, staged as a full-dress early-’90s period piece. As usual, the performance was expert, slick, charming. It was also oddly anonymous, a demonstration of virtuosity that left little impression of the virtuoso. Mars is the most egoless superstar in recent memory. Onstage with his band, he’s a lead singer, first among equals, not a spotlight-hogging solo artist. It’s another example of Mars’s savvy. The divas and divos who have dominated pop for 15 years are in commercial decline. Today’s young fans consume music via streaming playlists on mobile phones, a medium that favors songs over stars. In place of a plus-size personality, Mars offers his own playlist: impeccably made, irrefutably catchy, epoch-straddling hits that saturate our airwaves and datastreams. You could say we’re dripping in them. ?Jody Rosen is a contributing writer for the magazine.Photograph by Mike Marsland/Getty ImagesHow do you sing a song that stirs up so much feeling?By DESSA‘When you sing the line ‘rocket’s red glare,’ fireworks are going to go off. Then, when you get to ‘O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,’ an eagle named Challenger is going to take off and soar over the stadium.” Becky, my tour manager, was talking me through the mechanics of my gig on April 5. That day I am scheduled to sing the national anthem at the Minnesota Twins’ season opener in Minneapolis. “He’s a professional sports eagle,” Becky explained. “He has a website.”Being invited to perform “The Star-Spangled Banner” is both flattering and frightening. On one hand, it’s exciting to be part of such a grand spectacle. On the other, that song is crazy hard to sing. I’ll have to begin on exactly the right note to make sure my voice can dip for the lowest pitches and reach for the high one — between me and the eagle, I’m not sure whose assignment is more acrobatic.In addition to the musical concerns, there are other considerations. I’ve wondered if simply singing the anthem has become a loaded political statement, given the protests in the N.F.L. Back in 2016, quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the anthem as a gesture of protest. He was motivated, he said, by social inequity and police brutality targeting people of color. Some Americans praised Kaepernick for moral tenacity in the face of likely censure from the league. Others criticized him for having disrespected the flag and, by extension, the military service of those who fought under it. Commentators took sides, dug in, got mad. The president got involved. For many months, national media were passionately concerned with the question Was this man listening to the song wrong?It’s an unusual query. Normally we’re allowed to listen to music any way we like, as long as we don’t talk over the quiet parts and we keep our iPhones out of other people’s line of sight. But listening to the anthem is a scripted performance in itself, with stage directions (face the flag), prescribed postures (standing, right hand over heart) and even a wardrobe change (a bit of federal law advises men to “remove their headdress” for the performance).During the ensuing controversy, Americans argued with one another about what exactly the flag symbolizes, what the anthem means and what kneeling signifies. Thinking about my own symbolic role in the ceremony, I’ve asked myself: Is there a way to perform this song that communicates respect to the veterans and also welcome to the activists — while still rooting the Twins to victory over the Mariners?To prepare, I’ve read the words of “The Star-Spangled Banner” many times. I’ve read critical analyses of the Francis Scott Key poem from which they’re drawn. But it wasn’t until one recent night, reading the lyrics on my laptop, singing in my kitchen, that the punctuation really hit me. The part of the song that we sing at sporting events — it ends with a question mark: “Does that star-spangled banner yet wave/O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?” Whatever symbolic statement the anthem makes, it’s also literally posing a question: Did we survive that in one piece? A year and a half after a divisive election — with fresh strains on race relations, irreconcilable responses to gun violence and increasingly frequent political stalemates — we’re asking the same question in 2018.Symbols aren’t neatly mandated — we can’t assign cultural significance to a flag or a song in the same way we set speed limits on federal highways. The meaning of a symbol is determined only by an organic, collective agreement, which can flex or drift as culture changes. The anthem is fixed absolutely for only one listener: Challenger the Eagle. I’m told that he has been trained to swoop, circle and dive and that at the end of every performance he alights on his trainer’s arm just as the final note — and its question mark — echoes through the stadium. ?Dessa is a rapper, a singer and a writer.

sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - The majority owners of NASCAR, the company which operates the namesake U.S. car-racing series and other motorsport events, are exploring options that include the sale of a majority stake, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The move comes as NASCAR grapples with an aging fan base, stricter safety rules and a competitive media landscape that have weighed on its popularity and made it less attractive to advertisers and sponsors. The France family, which controls NASCAR, is working with investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc to identify a potential deal for the company, three sources said, cautioning that the deliberations are at exploratory stage and no agreement of any kind is certain.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. NASCAR and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.NASCAR could attract interest from media companies and private equity firms, according to the sources. The company's exact valuation could not be established, though the sources said it could be worth several billions of dollars. The company was founded by Bill France Sr. in Daytona Beach, Florida in 1948. Drivers in its races, such as Dale Earnhardt Sr, became household names, and major companies rushed to have their brands affiliated with NASCAR.But as its loyal fans grew older, younger consumers showed less enthusiasm for the sport, driving TV ratings down. There is still, however, a lot of competition between broadcasters, technology companies and cable operators for live sports rights, as advertisers seek events that viewers want to watch real-time. ""In a time period that is attractive for live event and live entertainment, Nascar has struggled,"" said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. ""There is absolutely a desire to own rather than license content but everything has a price.""NASCAR has been dabbling in so-called e-sports in a bid to reach younger audiences. Earlier this year, 704Games, NASCAR's exclusive video game licensee, said it would bring NASCAR Heat Champions to Daytona International Speedway during the Daytona 500 weekend.  As a privately held company, NASCAR does not disclose earnings. However, International Speedway Corp, which hosts the Daytona 500 rally and owns 12 of the 23 NASCAR Cup Series tracks, reported a 1.6 percent year-on-year drop in admissions revenue in its fiscal 2017, blaming it ""substantially"" on NASCAR events. In 2017, Liberty Media Corp spent more than $8 billion, including debt, to acquire international motor sports league Formula 1, ending a long-running saga surrounding the sport’s ownership and potential flotation. The new owners have shaken up its management, and put a sharper focus on new media markets and boosted its presence in North America.  (Reporting by Liana B.

Outerbridge set up a tennis court in Staten Island in the 1870s. It may have been the first in America.
Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. Now, we’re adding the stories of other remarkable people.1852-1886Established what may have been America’s first tennis court in the 1870s.By AMISHA PADNANI MARCH 8, 2018Mary Ewing Outerbridge didn’t have an easy time bringing tennis to America in 1874.First she had to get past customs agents. And they were suspicious. What was this large net? Clearly it wasn’t for fishing, they said. And what were these stringed things with long handles?By AMISHA PADNANI and JESSICA BENNETT MARCH 8, 2018Obituary writing is more about life than death: the last word, a testament to a human contribution.Yet who gets remembered — and how — inherently involves judgment. To look back at the obituary archives can, therefore, be a stark lesson in how society valued various achievements and achievers.Since 1851, The New York Times has published thousands of obituaries: of heads of state, opera singers, the inventor of Stove Top stuffing and the namer of the Slinky. The vast majority chronicled the lives of men, mostly white ones.Charlotte Brontë wrote “Jane Eyre”; Emily Warren Roebling oversaw construction of the Brooklyn Bridge when her husband fell ill; Madhubala transfixed Bollywood; Ida B. Wells campaigned against lynching. Yet all of their deaths went unremarked in our pages, until now.Below you’ll find obituaries for these and others who left indelible marks but were nonetheless overlooked. We’ll be adding to this collection each week, as Overlooked becomes a regular feature in the obituaries section, and expanding our lens beyond women.You can use this form to nominate candidates for future “Overlooked” obits. Read an essay from our obituaries editor about how he approaches subjects and learn more about how the project came to be.1862-1931Took on racism in the Deep South with powerful reporting on lynchings.By CAITLIN DICKERSON MARCH 8, 2018It was not all that unusual when, in 1892, a mob dragged Thomas Moss out of a Memphis jail in his pajamas and shot him to death over a feud that began with a game of marbles. But his lynching changed history because of its effect on one of the nation’s most influential journalists, who was also the godmother of his first child: Ida B. Wells.“It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed,” Wells wrote in 1892 in the introduction to “Southern Horrors,” one of her seminal works about lynching, “Somebody must show that the Afro-American race is more sinned against than sinning, and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so.”c. 1875-1907A feminist poet and revolutionary who became a martyr known as China’s ‘Joan of Arc.’By AMY QIN MARCH 8, 2018With her passion for wine, swords and bomb making, Qiu Jin was unlike most women born in late 19th-century China. As a girl, she wrote poetry and studied Chinese martial heroines like Hua Mulan (yes, that Mulan) fantasizing about one day seeing her own name in the history books.But her ambitions ran up against China’s deeply rooted patriarchal society, which held that a woman’s place remained in the home. Undeterred, Qiu rose to become an early and fierce advocate for the liberation of Chinese women, defying prevailing Confucian gender and class norms by unbinding her feet, cross-dressing and leaving her young family to pursue an education abroad.1923-1971A photographer whose portraits have compelled or repelled generations of viewers.By JAMES ESTRIN MARCH 8, 2018Diane Arbus was a daughter of privilege who spent much of her adult life documenting those on the periphery of society. Since she killed herself in 1971, her unblinking portraits have made her a seminal figure in modern-day photography and an influence on three generations of photographers, though she is perhaps just as famous for her unconventional lifestyle and her suicide.1945-1992A transgender pioneer and activist who was a fixture of Greenwich Village street life.By SEWELL CHAN MARCH 8, 2018Marsha P. Johnson was an activist, a prostitute, a drag performer and, for nearly three decades, a fixture of street life in Greenwich Village. She was a central figure in a gay liberation movement energized by the 1969 police raid on the Stonewall Inn. She was a model for Andy Warhol. She battled severe mental illness. She was usually destitute and, for much of her life, effectively homeless.When she died at 46, under murky circumstances, in summer 1992, Johnson was mourned by her many friends, but her death did not attract much notice in the mainstream press.1932-1963A postwar poet unafraid to confront her own despair.By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS MARCH 8, 2018She made sure to spare the children, leaving milk and bread for the two toddlers to find when they woke up. She stuffed the cracks of the doors and windows with cloths and tea towels. Then she turned on the gas.On the morning of Feb. 11, 1963, a Monday, a nurse found the poet Sylvia Plath in her flat on Fitzroy Road in London, an address where W.B. Yeats had once lived. She was “lying on the floor of the kitchen with her head resting on the oven,” according to a local paper, the St. Pancras Chronicle.1920-1951Cancer cells were taken from her body without permission. They led to a medical revolution.By ADEEL HASSAN MARCH 8, 2018She never traveled farther than Baltimore from her family home in southern Virginia, but her cells have traveled around the earth and far above it, too.She was buried in an unmarked grave, but the trillions of those cells — generated from a tiny patch taken from her body — are labeled in university labs and biotechnology companies across the world, where they continue to spawn and to play the critical role in a 67-year parade of medical advances.1933-1969A Bollywood legend whose tragic life mirrored Marilyn Monroe’s.By AISHA KHAN MARCH 8, 2018It was probably the first ghost story in Indian cinema. A bewildered young man in a mansion chasing glimpses of an ethereal, veiled beauty. The movie, “Mahal,” was a huge success, making the lead actress, Madhubala, who was barely 16, a superstar overnight.Nearly seven decades later, strains of the film’s signature song, “Aayega aane wala” (He will come), are instantly recognizable to most Indians, evoking the suspenseful tale of lost love and reincarnation.1843-1903Oversaw the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge after her engineer husband fell ill.By JESSICA BENNETT MARCH 8, 2018It was not customary for a woman to accompany a man to a construction site in the late 19th century. Petticoats tended to get in the way of physical work.But when Washington A. Roebling, the chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge, fell ill, it was his wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who stepped in — managing, liaising and politicking between city officials, workers, and her husband’s bedside to see the world’s first steel-wire suspension bridge to completion. She would become the first person to cross the bridge, too — carrying a rooster with her, as the story has it, for good luck.1891-1964A Harlem Renaissance-era writer whose heritage informed her modernist take on the topic of race.By BONNIE WERTHEIM MARCH 8, 2018When Nella Larsen died, in 1964, she left little behind: a ground-floor apartment, two published novels, some short stories, a few letters. She was childless, divorced and estranged from her half sister, who, in some accounts, upon learning she was to inherit $35,000 of Larsen’s savings, denied knowing the writer existed.It was a fitting end for a woman whose entire life had been a story of swift erasure.1815-1852A gifted mathematician who is now recognized as the first computer programmer.By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER MARCH 8, 2018A century before the dawn of the computer age, Ada Lovelace imagined the modern-day, general-purpose computer. It could be programmed to follow instructions, she wrote in 1843. It could not just calculate but also create, as it “weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.”The computer she was writing about, the British inventor Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, was never built. But her writings about computing have earned Lovelace — who died of uterine cancer in 1852 at 36 — recognition as the first computer programmer.1878-1955The first American woman to win an Olympic championship.By MARGALIT FOX MARCH 8, 2018The first American woman to win an Olympic championship died without ever knowing what she had achieved.That woman, Margaret Abbott, won the ladies’ golf competition, as the event was genteelly known, at the 1900 Games in Paris. She received a gilded porcelain bowl, a smattering of coverage in the newspapers and then nothing.How one editor’s personal thoughts on diversity led to Overlooked.

sports,"AdvertisementSupported byCavaliers 128, Raptors 93By Benjamin HoffmanIt would have been a career night for nearly any other player in the N.B.A., but for LeBron James, a line of 29 points, eight rebounds and 11 assists in the Cleveland Cavaliers’ series-clinching win against the Toronto Raptors on Monday hardly seemed noteworthy. That’s how outlandish expectations for James have gotten.These playoffs have offered plenty of highlights for James. He’s crossed the 40-point mark four times, recorded two triple-doubles, and hit two game-winning buzzer beaters. He broke Tim Duncan’s record for career postseason minutes played (in 28 fewer games than Duncan) and he so thoroughly humiliated the top-seeded Raptors on their home court that the term “LeBronto” was coined.He even managed to make high-arching fadeaway jumpers from the midrange look cool as he regularly used DeMar DeRozan’s signature shot to defeat him.But in Monday’s 128-93 win in Cleveland that gave the Cavaliers a sweep of the Eastern Conference semifinal series, James’s often-underwhelming supporting cast provided nearly as many first-half highlights as their unquestioned leader did. Kevin Love, never known for his defensive tenacity, was a force around the basket, J.R. Smith poured in 12 first-quarter points, and Kyle Korver did stellar work beyond the perimeter, going 3 for 3 from 3-point range.James scored just 2 points in the first quarter and 10 in the half. But even his most frequent detractor, the FS1 commentator Skip Bayless, seemed to understand that taking things easy for a little while and letting the other Cavaliers do the heavy lifting made sense.James was never going to take the whole game off. In the second half he reasserted himself as the center of the Cavaliers’ universe and slammed the door on the Raptors, extending his own record to 12 career sweeps in best-of-seven series. The latest quick dismissal earned James and his teammates a minimum of five days of rest before they play another game, which could stretch to seven depending on how the series between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers plays out. (Philadelphia picked itself off the mat in Game 4 on Monday, avoiding a sweep by Boston.)“We’re about to get some rest,” James said emphatically in an on-court interview broadcast on TNT. “I’m definitely about to get some rest.”Cleveland appeared to be running on fumes entering the series against the Raptors, having just finished a hard-fought, seven-game series against the Indiana Pacers. B ut instead of wilting they seemed to get stronger leading into what will be James’s eighth consecutive appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals.The question, of course, is whether any of James’s heroics will ultimately matter. In the conference finals he will be facing one of two youth-laden teams engineered to try to end his dominant run. The 76ers have “The Process,” and the Celtics were similarly built through free agency and the draft; whichever team survives will want to prove that their many can beat the Cavaliers’ few.Even if James can will his teammates beyond Boston or Philadelphia, he then would face long odds in the finals against the challenger from the Western Conference, most likely either the Golden State Warriors or the Houston Rockets, as both teams hold 3-1 series leads.For now, James will rest and wait to see how things play out. After he proved that Toronto’s deep lineup was no match for him, he will be eager to prove the same is true for the other teams that appear so much better on paper. At some point people may be reminded to stop doubting him, at least as far as Eastern Conference playoff games are concerned.And if things don’t work out in the playoffs, Enes Kanter has suggested he can join the Knicks.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThe number of jobs held by people of color and women in sports departments at newspapers and websites has improved slightly but remains low, with most positions dominated by white males, according to a study released Wednesday.The report by Central Florida's Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports issued the more than 75 outlets belonging to the Associated Press Sports Editors a second straight B grade for racial hiring, a D-plus for overall hiring practices and a fifth consecutive failing grade for gender hires in jobs that include sports editor, columnist, reporter and copy editor.Richard Lapchick, the director of the institute and the study's primary author, said the percentages rose in nine of the 10 hiring categories — five each for racial hiring, five for gender hiring — that were studied.""But in most cases, those were very small increases,"" Lapchick said. ""Particularly in gender-hiring practices, where it continues to earn another F, there is a very long way to go.""The report was the sixth on APSE since 2006 and the first since 2014. Typically a biannual study, it was delayed by two years because the group that publishes it had also undertaken several additional projects.The study found that while people of color occupy higher percentages of newsrooms than they did four years ago, white people continue to hold a significant majority of positions. According to the report, 85 percent of the sports editors, 76 percent of assistant sports editors, 80 percent of the columnists, 82 percent of the reporters and nearly 78 percent of the copy editors and designers last year were white.Also, news outlets received failing grades for gender hires in four of five positions — sports editor, columnist, reporter and copy editor — but did receive a C-minus grade in hiring assistant sports editors, of which 30 percent were women. The study found that 90 percent of sports editors and 88.5 percent of reporters were men.Jeff Rosen, APSE president and sports editor of The Kansas City Star, said he is ""challenging my fellow sports editors and managers and directors to broaden every search for job candidates that they make when they're able to hire for a position.""The study praised ESPN's hiring practices, with Lapchick saying that ""under the leadership of (former president) John Skipper ... ESPN has been a leader in hiring of women and people of color in key positions.""Of the 82 people of color who are either sports editors or assistant sports editors, 53 worked for ESPN. Of the 89 women who were assistant sports editors, 75 worked for ESPN, and of the 44 women who are columnists at what the study calls ""A'' newspapers and websites, 38 worked for ESPN.The study was requested by the APSE, which Lapchick called ""very encouraging."" He said the media organization is the only group to ask for a study from the institute that also issues regular reports on hiring practices in professional sports leagues and colleges and universities.""I think the (APSE) leadership wants to keep that spotlight on what needs to be done to make the sports media more diverse and inclusive, and I absolutely applaud the leadership for continuing to want to do this study,"" he said.Lapchick once again recommended APSE consider formalizing a policy similar to the NFL's Rooney Rule, which requires organizations to have a diverse pool of candidates, including women and people of color, for each key job opening.""Their position is probably like the NCAA's position ... They don't have control over the individual members and what they do,"" Lapchick said. ""So they have encouraged the individual members to open the hiring process that way.""AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

Judge Kimba M. Wood had barely finished a hearing this week that involved both Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s lawyer, and — in a stunning revelation — the Fox News host Sean Hannity, when the right-wing media machine started going after her.Info Wars, the conspiracy theory website run by Alex Jones, posted an article that distilled Judge Wood’s 30-year career to a single Saturday five years ago when she performed the wedding of the left-wing billionaire George Soros. Keeping with the theme of a liberal cabal, the Washington Times mentioned that another progressive bigwig — Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader — was also at the festivities. Joining the attacks, Fox News and NRA TV also soon chimed in.Given its explosive mix of money, sex and presidential politics, the case engulfing Mr. Cohen — an investigation into whether he broke the law by suppressing scandals about women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump — was almost certain to provoke a pushback and present a challenge to any judge called upon to manage it.But the Cohen affair is not Judge Wood’s first turn in the political spotlight. In 1993, after five years on the bench, she was considered for United States attorney general by President Bill Clinton after an earlier nominee, Zoë Baird, was found to have hired undocumented immigrants as nannies and failed to pay their taxes. But Judge Wood was asked to withdraw her name after telling White House screeners that she was sponsoring her own nanny for a green card — which was legal then — and that she had paid all the necessary taxes.Advertisement“I have fulfilled every legal requirement with respect to the employment of our babysitter,” she said in a statement at the time. “Nevertheless, and after further consultations, I have concluded that in the current political environment, proceeding further with the possibility of my nomination would be inappropriate.”AdvertisementAlthough she had done nothing illegal, Judge Wood, 74, was a casualty of politics and continued on the bench at Federal District Court in Manhattan, one of the country’s highest-profile judicial stages.Over the years, she has handled several prominent cases, earning a reputation for being sensitive, demanding and — as could be relevant in Mr. Cohen’s matter — unequivocal in her expectations of public officials.“She’s sort of the judicial equivalent of Teddy Roosevelt — she speaks softly but carries a big stick,” said Judd Burstein, a lawyer who has known Judge Wood for more than 30 years. “She has a wonderful judicial temperament. She’s very soft-spoken, very courteous to people, but completely no-nonsense.”In 2010, Judge Wood presided over the guilty pleas of 10 Russian spies who had worked as long-term sleeper agents — a case that inspired the TV show “The Americans.” Six years later, when she sentenced Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican leader of New York’s State Senate, to five years in prison on corruption charges, she admonished him for ignoring his “moral compass.”“Through your crimes,” she said, “you have caused immeasurable damage to New Yorkers’ confidence in the integrity of their government.”(Mr. Skelos’s conviction was later overturned on appeal after the Supreme Court narrowed the legal definition of corruption. He is scheduled to be retried in June, again before Judge Wood.)The case of Mr. Cohen more or less landed in her lap. In a bit of legal happenstance, Judge Wood was the emergency duty judge last week when Mr. Cohen’s lawyers filed a motion challenging the search warrants that federal agents used to seize his cellphones, papers and computers in a series of extraordinary raids this month. It remains unclear if Judge Wood will continue to preside as the matter moves forward. If criminal charges are ultimately brought, the case would be randomly reassigned.AdvertisementBut at least so far, Judge Wood has shown herself to be a firm jurist in the proceeding. On Monday, she compelled Mr. Cohen’s lawyers to reveal that Mr. Hannity had once been one of Mr. Cohen’s clients. Engaging her in a game of cat-and-mouse, the lawyers had at first described Mr. Hannity merely as a “prominent individual” who was embarrassed to be connected to the Cohen investigation.But after another lawyer — representing news media outlets — stepped in to argue that embarrassment was not sufficient grounds to keep the name a secret, Judge Wood decided she agreed. When Mr. Cohen’s lawyers pushed back, Judge Wood was blunt.“I’m directing you to disclose the name now,” she said.And so the lawyer did.Although the moment passed with a burst of audible gasps, Judge Wood’s measured approach — not raising her voice, but not backing down — showed a side of her that lawyers in her court know well.“What’s relevant to this case is that she’s so calm and levelheaded,” said Robert B. Fiske, Jr., a former United States attorney in Manhattan who has known Judge Wood since the 1980s. “Both sides, I think, would be very happy to have her as the judge. She has the ability to come into a high-pressure situation and deal with it intelligently and fairly.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

She studied for a time at the Sorbonne in Paris before attending Connecticut College and then Harvard Law School, graduating in 1969.Between college and law school, Judge Wood got a master’s degree from the London School of Economics while also briefly training, as something of a lark, to become a Playboy bunny. By 1971, she had embarked on what became a high-powered legal career, working briefly at the federal Office of Economic Opportunity and then taking a post at the New York law firm, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae, where she was among the first women to work on antitrust matters.In 1988, President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, appointed Judge Wood, a Democrat, to the federal bench in New York with the support of another Republican power broker, former State Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato. At that point, Judge Wood had little experience with criminal law and had never tried a case in front of a jury, but at her confirmation hearings Mr. D’Amato praised her for her “extraordinary background as a legal scholar.”In 1990, in one of her first important cases, Judge Wood sentenced the onetime junk-bond king Michael Milken to 10 years in prison for, among other crimes, violating federal securities laws. At the time, she said that she was issuing the severe prison term to send a message to the financial community, and also because Mr. Milken had chosen to break the law despite his good fortune and intelligence.In her sentencing decision, Judge Wood said that she received several letters from the public asking her to punish Mr. Milken for the “alleged abuses of the 1980s” — the savings-and-loan crisis, the takeover craze and the rampant use of junk bonds. She said that while she sympathized “with the anxiety expressed in these letters,” Mr. Milken should only be held accountable for his own offenses. “Our system of justice,” she went on, “protects everyone from being sentenced on supposition.”AdvertisementTwo years later, though, after Mr. Milken had cooperated with federal prosecutors against his Wall Street colleagues, Judge Wood followed the urgings of both sides in the case and reduced his sentence so that he only served about two years. “If society did not reward cooperation by the worst criminals (who often know most about high-level criminal schemes),” she said this time, “many serious crimes would go undetected and/or unpunished.”At that point, Judge Wood was working 12-to-14-hour days, such long stints that she gave up one of her hobbies, painting abstract canvases in oil. To relax, her family said, she played tennis and grew roses at a vacation home in Massachusetts. Her marriage at the time, to the journalist Michael Kramer, ended in divorce. She is now married to Frank E. Richardson, a wealthy financier who once served as an unpaid member of an investment advisory committee for Mr. Soros’s Quantum Industrial Holdings.Though Judge Wood declined to comment on the case, a spokesman for the court, Edward Friedland, said in a statement issued Wednesday: “From time to time, but rarely, Judge Wood and her husband came across George Soros at large social gatherings that had nothing to do with politics. When he asked Judge Wood to perform his wedding, she did so.”Mr. Friedland added that Judge Wood has performed over 40 marriage ceremonies during her time as a judge.But even if Judge Wood moves in rarefied circles, she still maintains an exacting demeanor in the courtroom, lawyers said.“She is very kind and sensitive, but she doesn’t suffer fools lightly,” said Gerald L. Shargel, a veteran defense lawyer who has appeared before Judge Wood on numerous occasions. “She’s always been very gracious in my experience, but anyone who thinks she’s going to be a walk in the park, they’re going to be sadly mistaken.”In 2010, for instance, Bennett Epstein, a lawyer who had a trial before Judge Wood, sent her a letter requesting permission to delay the proceeding so that he could attend the circumcision of his daughter’s child in Philadelphia — if, indeed, it was a boy. “Should the child be a girl,” Mr. Epstein wrote, “not much will happen in the way of public celebration. Some may even be disappointed.”In a flourish of pointed generosity, Judge Wood permitted the delay, but added a handwritten note to the bottom of Mr. Epstein’s missive.“If a daughter is born,” she wrote, “there will be a public celebration in court, with readings from poetry celebrating girls and women.”An earlier version of this article misstated a detail of Judge Kimba M. Wood’s marital history. Michael Kramer was her second husband, not her first.The earlier version also misstated the connection between her current husband, Frank E. Richardson, and George Soros’s Quantum Industrial Holdings. Mr. Richardson once served on an investment advisory committee for the group; he did not sit on its board.Follow Alan Feuer on Twitter: @alanfeuer Follow Benjamin Weiser on Twitter: @BenWeiserNYTDoris Burke contributed research.A version of this article appears in print on April 19, 2018, on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: On Bench for Cohen Case: ‘The Judicial Equivalent of Teddy Roosevelt’.

sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherHow did all the teams do in the first round of the N.F.L. draft? We won’t know for sure for a few years. But plenty of people want to weigh in right now.Here’s a look at the instant grades from CBS Sports, Sports Illustrated, Bleacher Report, For the Win at USA Today, Yahoo Sports and the draft site Walter Football.According to the experts, there are players who will turn their teams into winners, and others who are already terrible busts. Sometimes it’s the same player.[Read our analysis of every pick in the first round here.]___Mixed reviews for the top pick, who had looked like he was going to go more like No. 6 a few days ago. “Mayfield will bring a dynamic to the Browns offense that will allow them to do many things because of his mobility and his ability to throw the ball downfield,” said the most optimistic ranker, Bleacher Report. But Benjamin Hoffman of The New York Times raised the chilling specter of another Browns quarterback: “Is Mayfield essentially Johnny Manziel without as much baggage?” And USA Today said, “A lot will have to break right for the Oklahoma standout to end up as the best QB from this class.” Grade point average: 2.62.Suddenly it seems to be O.K. to use a top pick on a running back. Most felt the Giants did fine with this pick. Bleacher Report was already speculating about a 1,000-yard season, and Sports Illustrated called him a “once-in-a-generation running back.” The naysayer was USA Today, which felt a quarterback would have been a better choice for the Giants: “He’ll have to be LaDainian Tomlinson for this to be considered a good pick.” G.P.A.: 3.22A pretty solid thumbs up for the other New York pick as well. USA Today said, “The Jets gave up too much to move up to the No. 3 pick, but that won’t matter in a couple of years when Darnold develops into one of the league’s best quarterbacks.” “The Jets finally found their quarterback of the future,” Walter Football said. CBS was less excited, feeling Josh Allen or Josh Rosen would have been a better choice. G.P.A.: 3.22.Another top pick, another B- for the Browns. Defensive end Bradley Chubb was available, making this choice a little puzzling to some. “Maybe the Browns know something we don’t,” USA Today wrote, unconvincingly. Even Bleacher Report, which gave the pick an A- said, “This is a tough one to grade.” G.P.A.: 2.62.The hands-down best pick of the top five, the experts believe. “A pass rush consisting of Von Miller and Bradley Chubb is going to result in pure carnage for opposing offensive lines,” Bleacher Report said. Many thought the Broncos would take a quarterback, but few faulted this pick. G.P.A.: 3.92.An offensive guard in the top six? USA Today loved it, calling Nelson “the best offensive line prospect in recent memory.” Sports Illustrated was not impressed, saying the Colts should have gone with a defensive player: “The Colts can block better now, but it won’t matter if their opponents score 40 each week.” G.P.A.: 3.48Allen, the Wyoming quarterback, at one point was considered a candidate to go No. 1 over all. The Bills got him at No. 7 after a trade with the Buccaneers, and the grades were all over the place, ranging from an A+ to an F. CBS could not have liked it more: “They get the best QB in the draft and they had to go make the move to get him. Love the trade, love the pick.” USA Today said: “Allen is inaccurate, struggles to read defenses and is uncomfortable from the pocket. Other than that, he’s a pretty good quarterback.” It also reminded readers that last season the Bills at one point opted for Nathan Peterman over Tyrod Taylor. G.P.A.: 2.6A pick that almost everyone liked. “Feels like the Bears got the next great young linebacker,” Yahoo said. “Smith is a very intelligent linebacker who always seems to be in the right place at the right time,” Walter Football said. “He is a smart player, a strong leader, and is the type of guy coaches will trust to make decisions on the field,” Hoffman said in The Times. G.P.A.: 3.73Another Notre Dame lineman is chosen, but this one is not as much loved by the experts as Nelson is.“This is a bit of a reach, but the Niners needed to find an eventual replacement for Joe Staley, who turns 34 in August,” USA Today said. But Sports Illustrated noted, “Drafting McGlinchey is a bit of a head-scratcher given that the 49ers just gave left tackle Joe Staley a raise for the next two years.” Nobody really hated the pick, but few loved it, either, as grades ranged from B to C. G.P.A.: 2.45The Cards moved up to get Rosen, who most felt would go higher. “The best quarterback in the draft,” Bleacher Report said. “The most N.F.L.-ready passer,” CBS said. Rosen would undoubtedly have given this pick a high grade himself: “Nine mistakes were made ahead of me,” he said after being picked. G.P.A.: 3.77.The highest grade of the draft, even higher than Chubb, went to Derwin James, the safety selected by the Chargers at No. 17. The strong consensus had been that he would go much higher, giving the Chargers a steal this low. With three A+’s, two A’s and just one B, his G.P.A. was a 3.98. “James is an explosive athlete who can be an enforcer in the box, cover slot receivers or play deep safety,” wrote USA Today.Good grades also for these picks: Tremaine Edwards (Bills, No. 16) “An incredible player with a rare combination of size and speed,” Bleacher Report. Lamar Jackson (Ravens, No. 32) “An electric talent who will benefit from sitting behind Flacco,” Bleacher Report.The worst pick of the first round, according to the experts? Rashaad Penny, a running back taken by the Seahawks at No. 27. CBS gave the pick a C, and that was the high point. He also got a C-, a D+ and three D’s. Many felt Penny was a solid player but that wasting a first-round pick on a decent running back was a mistake. “Penny was seen as a second- or third-round prospect among teams,” wrote Walter Football. G.P.A.: 1.33.Two others that graded below a C: defensive end Marcus Davenport, taken by the Saints at No. 14 (“This is absolutely atrocious,” Walter Football), and safety Terrell Edmunds, taken by the Steelers at No. 28 (“Edmunds is more of a Day 3 pick,” Bleacher Report).No player divided opinion more than Allen, but one who was close was Leighton Vander Esch, the linebacker who went to the Cowboys at No. 19. Bleacher Report gave the pick an A+: “Vander Esch can play all over the field and changes direction on a dime.” Sports Illustrated gave it a C: “Good player, but the glaring need at wideout going unaddressed can’t be forgotten.”One of them may be right. It may take a few years, but eventually we’ll find out.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressRALEIGH, N.C. — This spring was a busy one around the Atlantic Coast Conference — especially for the returning quarterbacks who won division titles last season.In a conference in which its only new head coach wasted no time getting comfortable in his new position and Louisville developed a replacement for its only Heisman Trophy winner, the main subplot revolved around the seemingly secure QBs who are trying to keep their jobs.That list includes both of the starters in last year's ACC championship game, Kelly Bryant of Clemson and Malik Rosier of Miami.Bryant, who took over for Deshaun Watson in 2017 and led the Tigers to their third straight ACC title and third consecutive playoff berth, was pushed by highly touted freshman Trevor Lawrence and sophomore Hunter Johnson.""We've got a really good situation,"" Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. ""Never had quite this type of situation where we've got really four guys (along with Chase Brice) that I think could go win with, literally. I think we could go win with any of those guys.""The Hurricanes wrapped up spring practice with Rosier facing a challenge from early enrollee Jarren Williams and others. When coach Mark Richt was asked following the final spring scrimmage if the competition was open, he responded ""absolutely ... until the bitter end.""Some things to watch around the ACC when preseason camps open during the summer:CLEMSON'S QB BATTLESwinney has an embarrassment of riches with Lawrence and Johnson — the nation's top recruits in both 2018 and '17, respectively — competing with Bryant, who accounted for 24 touchdowns while leading the Tigers to a 12-2 record. Lawrence broke Watson's Georgia high school records for yards passing and touchdowns, and Johnson was rated as the nation's top high school quarterback two years ago and played some as Bryant's backup.""Last year, we were starting over, and Kelly had no experience and Hunter was just getting here, trying to figure it out ... and Trevor wasn't here,"" Swinney said. ""So I think we're going to be in a much better starting point than we were this time last year.""EMBRACING THE PASTWillie Taggart, the league's only new coach in 2018, is taking over for Jimbo Fisher at Florida State and one of his first moves was to reconnect the Seminoles' tradition-rich past with their present — even bringing back Bobby Bowden for the spring game. ""I didn't feel we were really connected like we needed to be,"" said Taggart, a native Floridian. ""So we tried to put emphasis on just getting everyone back involved, people that built the program and made it to what it is today, and let them know we appreciate it. I think it's important that our football team understand those people that came before them as well. Because they're a big reason why they decided to come to Florida State.""A LONG PASSJawon Pass has the tough job of following a Heisman Trophy winner at Louisville, having spent two years as Lamar Jackson's understudy. At 6-foot-4 and 231 pounds, Pass probably won't tuck it and run quite as often as Jackson did when he won the Heisman two years ago — though coach Bobby Petrino says Pass does run the 40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds. ""He can throw the ball, he's big, he's got good vision,"" Petrino said. ""He's also fast, you know?""INSPIRED ORANGEIt might be difficult to find a tougher player in the league than Syracuse QB Rex Culpepper, who threw a touchdown pass in the spring game less than a month after being diagnosed with a treatable form of testicular cancer that doctors later discovered had spread to his abdominal lymph nodes. He's undergoing chemotherapy and hopes to be cleared to play this season.""He goes to class with a smile on his face. He comes to practice with a smile on his face yet he's a very, very serious competitor,"" coach Dino Babers said. ""Anytime you've got a young man at that age that's so focused and so determined, and he knows what he wants most, and he's not willing to trade that in for something at the moment, that person's going to always be a positive reflection, not only on himself and his family, but also on his teammates.""___AP Sports Writer Gary B.

Johnson was part of the Stonewall uprising, helped transgender youths and was an AIDS activist. She died at 46 under murky circumstances.
Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. Now, we’re adding the stories of other remarkable people.1945-1992A transgender pioneer and activist who was a fixture of Greenwich Village street life.By SEWELL CHAN MARCH 8, 2018Marsha P. Johnson was an activist, a prostitute, a drag performer and, for nearly three decades, a fixture of street life in Greenwich Village. She was a central figure in a gay liberation movement energized by the 1969 police raid on the Stonewall Inn. She was a model for Andy Warhol. She battled severe mental illness. She was usually destitute and, for much of her life, effectively homeless.When she died at 46, under murky circumstances, in summer 1992, Johnson was mourned by her many friends, but her death did not attract much notice in the mainstream press.By AMISHA PADNANI and JESSICA BENNETT MARCH 8, 2018Obituary writing is more about life than death: the last word, a testament to a human contribution.Yet who gets remembered — and how — inherently involves judgment. To look back at the obituary archives can, therefore, be a stark lesson in how society valued various achievements and achievers.Since 1851, The New York Times has published thousands of obituaries: of heads of state, opera singers, the inventor of Stove Top stuffing and the namer of the Slinky. The vast majority chronicled the lives of men, mostly white ones.Charlotte Brontë wrote “Jane Eyre”; Emily Warren Roebling oversaw construction of the Brooklyn Bridge when her husband fell ill; Madhubala transfixed Bollywood; Ida B.

Wells.“It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed,” Wells wrote in 1892 in the introduction to “Southern Horrors,” one of her seminal works about lynching, “Somebody must show that the Afro-American race is more sinned against than sinning, and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so.”c. 1875-1907A feminist poet and revolutionary who became a martyr known as China’s ‘Joan of Arc.’By AMY QIN MARCH 8, 2018With her passion for wine, swords and bomb making, Qiu Jin was unlike most women born in late 19th-century China.

Petticoats tended to get in the way of physical work.But when Washington A. Roebling, the chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge, fell ill, it was his wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who stepped in — managing, liaising and politicking between city officials, workers, and her husband’s bedside to see the world’s first steel-wire suspension bridge to completion. She would become the first person to cross the bridge, too — carrying a rooster with her, as the story has it, for good luck.1891-1964A Harlem Renaissance-era writer whose heritage informed her modernist take on the topic of race.By BONNIE WERTHEIM MARCH 8, 2018When Nella Larsen died, in 1964, she left little behind: a ground-floor apartment, two published novels, some short stories, a few letters. She was childless, divorced and estranged from her half sister, who, in some accounts, upon learning she was to inherit $35,000 of Larsen’s savings, denied knowing the writer existed.It was a fitting end for a woman whose entire life had been a story of swift erasure.1815-1852A gifted mathematician who is now recognized as the first computer programmer.By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER MARCH 8, 2018A century before the dawn of the computer age, Ada Lovelace imagined the modern-day, general-purpose computer.

sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherBreakdancing might seem like a product of the ’80s, like jelly bracelets or parachute pants. But some au courant sports officials believe it could have a bright future — at the Olympic Games.Plans are going smoothly for a new breakdancing event at the Youth Olympics in Argentina in October, said Lukas Hinder, the president of the World Dance Sport Federation, which promotes competitive dancing events.“We are quite on track with the preparations for the Youth Olympic Games,” Hinder told Inside the Games.  “It’s a youth-orientated sport, it’s very cool, it’s innovative, it’s something new.”The breakdancing event will be the debut at the Youth Olympics of dance sport. It grabbed the spot ahead of more traditional dance competitions like ballroom and Latin dancing. The official program lists three medal events: “B Boys,” “B Girls” and “Breaking Mixed Team.”In what must be an Olympics first, prospective contestants were invited to submit a video to audition for a spot in the competition. Rich Colon, 52, a pioneering B boy known as Crazy Legs, was involved in the judging process to narrow the field.The Youth Olympics can be a proving ground for events that eventually wind up in the Olympics. The 2014 youth event in Nanjing, China, included rugby sevens, which debuted at the Olympics in 2016, and skateboarding, which will be added in 2020.Also on the bill for 2018 are a basketball dunk contest, cross-country running, futsal (indoor soccer), and beach handball.The Olympics had shown itself to be willing in recent years to bend the definition of sports, adding sport climbing, for example, for the 2020 Games. But dancing has been a step too far — unless it’s on ice.Though breakdancing has not yet debuted, it has already spawned a dispute, Inside the Games reported. A breakdancer, Serouj Aprahamian, petitioned the I.O.C., claiming that the World Dance Sport Federation, known mostly for ballroom dancing, was not the right group to run breakdancing competitions. It has “absolutely no connection or credibility with any legitimate entity in the worldwide breaking community,” he contended.While there are plenty of breakdancers still out there, to many people it is still an art form most associated with the 1980s. Should breakdancing succeed at the Olympics, maybe the door would open for other ’80s events. Among the possibilities:Rubik’s cube: The top solvers can currently zip through the basic cube in less than 5 seconds. The Olympics would probably want to use the more challenging supercubes, like the 6 by 6, which can take a minute and a half.Hacky sack: The generically named “World Footbag” site reports that the record number of keep-ups by one man is 63,326. That took almost nine hours. A team of two has kept the sack up for 20 hours. Should the Olympics be looking for something that fits more easily in a TV window, it could consider a timed challenge. The record number of touches in five minutes is more than 1,000.Donkey Kong: A longstanding dispute over the world record in the arcade game seems to have come to a close, perhaps clearing the way for a showdown between nations in climbing ladders, jumping over barrels and hammering things. The Olympics might also consider the football game Tecmo Bowl, although whichever nation gets Bo Jackson would have a big advantage.Once people are dancing, cubing and video gaming at the Olympics, the door is wide open. Could a gold medal for best mullet be far off?AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. Now, we’re adding the stories of other remarkable people.1891-1964A Harlem Renaissance-era writer whose heritage informed her modernist take on the topic of race.By BONNIE WERTHEIM MARCH 8, 2018When Nella Larsen died, in 1964, she left little behind: a ground-floor apartment, two published novels, some short stories, a few letters.

To look back at the obituary archives can, therefore, be a stark lesson in how society valued various achievements and achievers.Since 1851, The New York Times has published thousands of obituaries: of heads of state, opera singers, the inventor of Stove Top stuffing and the namer of the Slinky. The vast majority chronicled the lives of men, mostly white ones.Charlotte Brontë wrote “Jane Eyre”; Emily Warren Roebling oversaw construction of the Brooklyn Bridge when her husband fell ill; Madhubala transfixed Bollywood; Ida B. Wells campaigned against lynching. Yet all of their deaths went unremarked in our pages, until now.Below you’ll find obituaries for these and others who left indelible marks but were nonetheless overlooked. We’ll be adding to this collection each week, as Overlooked becomes a regular feature in the obituaries section, and expanding our lens beyond women.You can use this form to nominate candidates for future “Overlooked” obits.

sports,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Marc TracyATLANTA — Drew Speraw, a Kansas State assistant coach, found himself in an unenviable position near the end of the Wildcats’ tight win over the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, last Sunday: He had to physically grab his boss.Bruce Weber, Kansas State’s head coach, is a defense-first guy. In the second half, while his team was on defense against U.M.B.C., the action was on the other end of the court from the Kansas State bench. As Weber yelled instructions and imprecations to his players over the noise of the crowd, he inched closer and closer to midcourt like a salmon traveling upstream in spurts and, like plenty of other coaches, even wandered onto the court itself sometimes.Those are no-nos in college basketball, grounds for a technical foul, which is a terrible thing during a close game. Just ask Kentucky Coach John Calipari, who got whistled for drifting beyond the coach’s box in his team’s loss to Kansas State Thursday night.In Kansas State’s game last weekend, Weber had already been warned. Fortunately, Speraw is used to it, and he knows the responsibility that goes with his position by Weber on the bench.“I’m the closest one,” Speraw said after Sunday’s game in Charlotte, N.C.On Wednesday, Weber said that while he is a frequent migrant down the sideline, one boundary is clear.“My thing is, if you yell at the refs, you should get a technical,” he said.But he defended his intention — leading his team to victory — and actions — shouting, pacing, pushing the limits of the coach’s box.“If we’re coaching our guys,” he said, “that’s what we’re paid to do.”The N.C.A.A. doesn’t necessarily disagree. This is the first season of an expanded coach’s box, which is the area the head coach may patrol during play. Vigorous sideline generals received an extra 10 feet this season; they may now roam from the baseline all the way to a mark 38 feet away. That’s a midrange jump shot from midcourt, which is 47 feet from the baseline.“I have had officials tell me that it was expanded for me,” Weber said.College basketball coaches are easy subjects for ridicule. N.B.A. fans scoff at their hyperactivity and point to professional coaches’ comparatively calm mien, even though N.B.A. coaches may stray as much as 43 feet from the baseline. Casual observers wonder why these blustering, nattily dressed bombasts can’t stay cool.The college coaches say they deserve sympathy. Their charges are younger than most players in the N.B.A. Their teams can feel especially far away while on defense, seeking crucial late-game stops out of vocal range for even the loudest coach. Most coaches are former players with decades of experience who now watch mostly helplessly as post-adolescents try to implement months of training in a few essential seconds. Their antics also make for great TV.Yet they have to stay inside an invisible box during games or risk a penalty that could tangibly hurt their team. The correct call for a coach’s box violation after a warning is a Class B technical foul, giving the other team one free throw and the ball, inbounded where it was when the foul was called.“I have a young team, and sometimes they don’t talk,” Alabama Coach Avery Johnson said last week between first- and second-round games. “You can hear it in my voice. I’ve got to talk for them. I got warned yesterday, and, probably, going to get warned tomorrow.”Despite plenty of yelling and straying, Johnson and Alabama lost to Duke on Sunday night.In a world where referees “T-up” coaches for far more subjectively determined violations, there is an argument that the coach’s box is extraneous, even condescending. Anecdotally, there appear to be few T’s actually called (the N.C.A.A. said it did not keep the statistic). Kansas Coach Bill Self complained that he had been whistled once this year “for sticking my toe two inches outside the box.”“We represent universities,” South Carolina Coach Frank Martin said in a phone interview. “We’re grown men. We’re employed. We get treated like we’re immature. We’ve got to be in this small little confined area. We’re not going to go to the other bench and instigate something.”This understanding was partly why the box was expanded, according to Art Hyland, secretary-rules editor of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball rules committee. It is also why referees are instructed to first give the bench a warning.“People felt empathy that the coaches really needed a little more room in order to do their job correctly,” Hyland said.An extra 10 feet turns out to be a lot, Self said Thursday in Omaha before the Jayhawks’ round of 16 game. He thought it was a “pretty insignificant change” when it was announced last June, but now that it has been in place for a season, he said, “It’s been a great rule.”“You feel like you can actually have a little bit more communication on the other end of the floor,” he said.On Wednesday, before Thursday night’s violation, Calipari blamed the tight strictures of the old box for one of the most infamous coach’s box technical fouls in the college game.In 1992, Calipari’s Massachusetts team was playing Kentucky in the round of 16 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The Minutemen had made up most of a double-digit deficit late in the second half when a referee called a technical foul on Calipari for a coach’s box violation. The referee “was 50 feet away from the UMass bench when he called it,” The Baltimore Sun reported. The call swung the momentum back the Wildcats’ way, and they won. (They lost the next game to Duke on Christian Laettner’s famous buzzer-beater.)“At the Spectrum where they had all those lines,” Calipari said. “I’m standing there and the guy calls a T from 90 feet away. ‘You’re out of the box.’ And I really wasn’t out of the box, but it looked like it.”Calipari had no such defense or excuse Thursday night.In practice, there is frequently a live-and-let-live dynamic between referees and hyperactive coaches. Warnings are issued; actual fouls, less so.Ed Hightower, a retired referee, said officials often find that assistant coaches are better interlocutors for conveying the warnings. Speraw, Weber’s assistant, said that the referees had spoken to the staff at halftime of the U.M.B.C. game.When warning coaches that they were in danger of violating this rule, Hightower said he would often say, “You don’t want to make me do something I don’t want to do.”“Ninety percent of the time, I would say, the coaches are just so caught up in the moment, coaching their kids,” Hightower said. “It’s an emotional sport.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

Good morning.(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)For California communities struggling with homelessness, the challenge has been to reconcile two demands: Moving encampments of people off sidewalks and into shelters, while dealing with neighborhood opposition that, to name one example, blocked Orange County’s attempt to build homeless camps.There are few places where the crisis is as severe as it is in Los Angeles, where 25,000 people are living on the streets. Mayor Eric M. Garcetti on Monday will announce an aggressive $20 million program to work around neighborhood opposition and potentially build temporary 100-bed shelters on city-owned land in all 15 City Council districts.To help speed the opening of the 1,500 beds, the plan includes an emergency declaration that would in effect override existing zoning, building and fire code provisions.This measure comes as Mr. Garcetti, who is exploring a potential presidential bid in 2020 and was in Iowa this weekend, has come under criticism for the rise in homelessness.AdvertisementThe calculation is that as people confront growing encampments lining sidewalks from downtown Los Angeles to Venice their attitudes toward homelessness are changing.AdvertisementPeter Lynn, the executive director of the Homeless Services Authority, said temporary beds provided a bridge for people to find permanent housing — either on their own or in housing Los Angeles is building with $1.2 billion authorized by voters in 2016. “The objective is not to shelter everybody, and that’s O.K.,” he said. “It’s not as if we have infinite resources.”A district is not obligated to build a shelter, and could forfeit its money, though officials argued that was unlikely given the pervasiveness of the problem.“We have no intention to force projects on any district,” said Matt Szabo, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff. “We are confident that there is sufficient consensus that we need these projects that you will see a lot of progress really quickly.”Under the plan, city crews will clean up encampments after their occupants have moved to the temporary shelters.“We’re not trying to say this will take care of the entire homeless population,” said Suzi Emmerling, the mayor’s director of communications. “But we do believe it will make a significant dent.”The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).

MARCH 8, 2018

Lacks, a former tobacco farmer, died of cancer at 31, but her endlessly renewable cancer cells have been at the core of advances in treatment for many ailments.
Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. Now, we’re adding the stories of other remarkable people.1920-1951Cancer cells were taken from her body without permission. They led to a medical revolution.By ADEEL HASSAN MARCH 8, 2018She never traveled farther than Baltimore from her family home in southern Virginia, but her cells have traveled around the earth and far above it, too.She was buried in an unmarked grave, but the trillions of those cells — generated from a tiny patch taken from her body — are labeled in university labs and biotechnology companies across the world, where they continue to spawn and to play the critical role in a 67-year parade of medical advances.By AMISHA PADNANI and JESSICA BENNETT MARCH 8, 2018Obituary writing is more about life than death: the last word, a testament to a human contribution.Yet who gets remembered — and how — inherently involves judgment. To look back at the obituary archives can, therefore, be a stark lesson in how society valued various achievements and achievers.Since 1851, The New York Times has published thousands of obituaries: of heads of state, opera singers, the inventor of Stove Top stuffing and the namer of the Slinky. The vast majority chronicled the lives of men, mostly white ones.Charlotte Brontë wrote “Jane Eyre”; Emily Warren Roebling oversaw construction of the Brooklyn Bridge when her husband fell ill; Madhubala transfixed Bollywood; Ida B. Wells campaigned against lynching. Yet all of their deaths went unremarked in our pages, until now.Below you’ll find obituaries for these and others who left indelible marks but were nonetheless overlooked. We’ll be adding to this collection each week, as Overlooked becomes a regular feature in the obituaries section, and expanding our lens beyond women.You can use this form to nominate candidates for future “Overlooked” obits. Read an essay from our obituaries editor about how he approaches subjects and learn more about how the project came to be.1862-1931Took on racism in the Deep South with powerful reporting on lynchings.By CAITLIN DICKERSON MARCH 8, 2018It was not all that unusual when, in 1892, a mob dragged Thomas Moss out of a Memphis jail in his pajamas and shot him to death over a feud that began with a game of marbles. But his lynching changed history because of its effect on one of the nation’s most influential journalists, who was also the godmother of his first child: Ida B. Wells.“It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed,” Wells wrote in 1892 in the introduction to “Southern Horrors,” one of her seminal works about lynching, “Somebody must show that the Afro-American race is more sinned against than sinning, and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so.”c. 1875-1907A feminist poet and revolutionary who became a martyr known as China’s ‘Joan of Arc.’By AMY QIN MARCH 8, 2018With her passion for wine, swords and bomb making, Qiu Jin was unlike most women born in late 19th-century China. As a girl, she wrote poetry and studied Chinese martial heroines like Hua Mulan (yes, that Mulan) fantasizing about one day seeing her own name in the history books.But her ambitions ran up against China’s deeply rooted patriarchal society, which held that a woman’s place remained in the home. Undeterred, Qiu rose to become an early and fierce advocate for the liberation of Chinese women, defying prevailing Confucian gender and class norms by unbinding her feet, cross-dressing and leaving her young family to pursue an education abroad.1852-1886Established what may have been America’s first tennis court in the 1870s.By AMISHA PADNANI MARCH 8, 2018Mary Ewing Outerbridge didn’t have an easy time bringing tennis to America in 1874.First she had to get past customs agents. And they were suspicious. What was this large net? Clearly it wasn’t for fishing, they said. And what were these stringed things with long handles?1923-1971A photographer whose portraits have compelled or repelled generations of viewers.By JAMES ESTRIN MARCH 8, 2018Diane Arbus was a daughter of privilege who spent much of her adult life documenting those on the periphery of society. Since she killed herself in 1971, her unblinking portraits have made her a seminal figure in modern-day photography and an influence on three generations of photographers, though she is perhaps just as famous for her unconventional lifestyle and her suicide.1945-1992A transgender pioneer and activist who was a fixture of Greenwich Village street life.By SEWELL CHAN MARCH 8, 2018Marsha P. Johnson was an activist, a prostitute, a drag performer and, for nearly three decades, a fixture of street life in Greenwich Village. She was a central figure in a gay liberation movement energized by the 1969 police raid on the Stonewall Inn. She was a model for Andy Warhol. She battled severe mental illness. She was usually destitute and, for much of her life, effectively homeless.When she died at 46, under murky circumstances, in summer 1992, Johnson was mourned by her many friends, but her death did not attract much notice in the mainstream press.1932-1963A postwar poet unafraid to confront her own despair.By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS MARCH 8, 2018She made sure to spare the children, leaving milk and bread for the two toddlers to find when they woke up. She stuffed the cracks of the doors and windows with cloths and tea towels. Then she turned on the gas.On the morning of Feb. 11, 1963, a Monday, a nurse found the poet Sylvia Plath in her flat on Fitzroy Road in London, an address where W.B. Yeats had once lived. She was “lying on the floor of the kitchen with her head resting on the oven,” according to a local paper, the St. Pancras Chronicle.1933-1969A Bollywood legend whose tragic life mirrored Marilyn Monroe’s.By AISHA KHAN MARCH 8, 2018It was probably the first ghost story in Indian cinema. A bewildered young man in a mansion chasing glimpses of an ethereal, veiled beauty. The movie, “Mahal,” was a huge success, making the lead actress, Madhubala, who was barely 16, a superstar overnight.Nearly seven decades later, strains of the film’s signature song, “Aayega aane wala” (He will come), are instantly recognizable to most Indians, evoking the suspenseful tale of lost love and reincarnation.1843-1903Oversaw the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge after her engineer husband fell ill.By JESSICA BENNETT MARCH 8, 2018It was not customary for a woman to accompany a man to a construction site in the late 19th century. Petticoats tended to get in the way of physical work.But when Washington A. Roebling, the chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge, fell ill, it was his wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who stepped in — managing, liaising and politicking between city officials, workers, and her husband’s bedside to see the world’s first steel-wire suspension bridge to completion. She would become the first person to cross the bridge, too — carrying a rooster with her, as the story has it, for good luck.1891-1964A Harlem Renaissance-era writer whose heritage informed her modernist take on the topic of race.By BONNIE WERTHEIM MARCH 8, 2018When Nella Larsen died, in 1964, she left little behind: a ground-floor apartment, two published novels, some short stories, a few letters. She was childless, divorced and estranged from her half sister, who, in some accounts, upon learning she was to inherit $35,000 of Larsen’s savings, denied knowing the writer existed.It was a fitting end for a woman whose entire life had been a story of swift erasure.1815-1852A gifted mathematician who is now recognized as the first computer programmer.By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER MARCH 8, 2018A century before the dawn of the computer age, Ada Lovelace imagined the modern-day, general-purpose computer. It could be programmed to follow instructions, she wrote in 1843. It could not just calculate but also create, as it “weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.”The computer she was writing about, the British inventor Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, was never built. But her writings about computing have earned Lovelace — who died of uterine cancer in 1852 at 36 — recognition as the first computer programmer.1878-1955The first American woman to win an Olympic championship.By MARGALIT FOX MARCH 8, 2018The first American woman to win an Olympic championship died without ever knowing what she had achieved.That woman, Margaret Abbott, won the ladies’ golf competition, as the event was genteelly known, at the 1900 Games in Paris. She received a gilded porcelain bowl, a smattering of coverage in the newspapers and then nothing.How one editor’s personal thoughts on diversity led to Overlooked.

sports,"Investigators believe a man in Arizona was distributing performance-enhancing drugs on a global scale, yet no charges have been filed. His clientele included pro athletes.By MICHAEL POWELLMARCH 26, 2018
On Aug. 25, 2015, a Swiss postal inspector reached into the river of 300,000 parcels that pour into that nation every day and, for a routine inspection, plucked out two packages arriving from Arizona. Inspectors unwrapped them and found serried rows of bottles.The bottles were suspected of containing performance-enhancing drugs, so they were shipped to an antidoping laboratory for testing. Chemists discovered three synthetic compounds that are illicit gold for cheating athletes. One sped the healing of tendons and ligaments. Another helped build muscle mass. A third stimulated the body to burn fat.The Swiss authorities notified the organization in the United States that investigates sports doping, the United States Anti-Doping Agency, and shared the return-address sticker. The packages were shipped by someone named Thomas Mann.His name drew puzzled shrugs from Usada investigators. That name had never crossed their radar, and they could not find a home listing for someone with that name in their database in Arizona or anywhere else.AdvertisementThe name was then stored in the organization’s computer system and largely forgotten, until it resurfaced in a different context several months later, triggering an intense pursuit of Thomas Mann and an aggressive investigation of his enterprise that involved federal law enforcement as well as antidoping officials.The existence of the investigation and its extraordinary findings have not been previously reported.Investigators believe what they uncovered was a trafficker who sat at the center of one of the broadest sports doping networks in American history, with tendrils that extended to Europe and Asia. In one year, he shipped parcels containing performance-enhancing drugs to more than 8,000 people, they determined. His substance of choice was peptides, a newly popular (though banned) substance among athletes that is essentially a building block for protein.His clientele included a dozen pro football players and coaches; pro baseball players and a major league batting coach; and top track and field athletes. There were Olympians and potential Olympians, from discus throwers to sprinters to pole-vaulters to weight lifters to wrestlers.Investigators assembled what they considered a hay pile of incriminating evidence: surveillance video of the man making the shipments; invoices and payment receipts; email messages; and testimony from several athletes who purchased drugs from him that corroborated the nature of his business.Yet the dealer has not faced criminal charges. He distributed drugs that inhabit a hazy gray zone. Prosecutors generally treat the possession of peptides, which are illegal without a medical prescription, as a misdemeanor.AdvertisementInvestigators also determined something else: The man’s name was not Thomas Mann. His real name was Michael A. Moorcones, and he had left the faintest of footprints. Born in Virginia, he was a lawyer with no law office, a distributor of sports drugs with no formal training as a pharmacist.I set out to find Moorcones. I drove 30 miles south of Phoenix to Queen Creek, Ariz., where suburbs expire in sun-blasted desert and the Superstition Mountains rise gray and jagged. I rang a doorbell in a subdivision. A balding, middle-aged man opened the door.Michael Moorcones?He nodded. “Yes?”I’m a reporter, I told him, and athletes tell me they purchased your performance-enhancing drugs. They say your substances help them out-train and outperform athletes who compete clean.Can we talk?Moorcones offered a hint of a chuckle. “I wouldn’t be interested in ever talking to anybody about anything. O.K.?”He moved to close the door.In late December 2015, about four months after the Swiss authorities had flagged the shipments from Thomas Mann, Al Jazeera released an explosive documentary called “The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers.” A retired professional hurdler from Britain had worked with the news organization to penetrate the world of illicit sports doping while carrying a hidden camera.An intriguing name was tucked into the Al Jazeera documentary. Underground chemists spoke with reverence of a Svengali who produced and sold them high-quality sports drugs. His name was Thomas Mann.A chemist explained in the documentary how fastidious he had to be when ordering performance-enhancing drugs from Mann: “If you even use the wrong language with him, saying, ‘Oh, I’m going to use this,’ right away, boom, you’d be kicked off.”Investigators pulled at Thomas Mann’s internet veil and found that he was using an alias, a name perhaps borrowed from the famous German novelist. He called his business Authentiquevie (French for “authentic life”); another forum, DatBTrue, provided a menu of his peptides and hormones, accompanied by detailed explanations of each drug. Four-star customer testimonials piled up.Advertisement“Tom carries it and is the only guy I trust to deliver actual peptides and not useless vials,” read one.His business model, according to investigators, was clever. They believe he operated the DatBTrue forum, a go-to place for savvy discussion of peptides. When an athlete on the forum would inquire about obtaining peptides, Moorcones, using a different name, would steer the athlete to Thomas Mann. So he was sending potential customers to himself.Moorcones, in the guise of Thomas Mann, or Tom Mann, would then rigorously vet the customers to make sure they were who they claimed to be and would be trustworthy clients.In the one year that Moorcones was under investigation, he had $1 million in sales.Moorcones’s business was a raging river in a much larger doping ecosystem. The demand for performance-enhancing drugs extends to every corner of professional and amateur sports, and well beyond. Name any sport, and chances are good that someone playing it has been caught doping in the past few months.Then there are wealthy users who flock to anti-aging medical clinics in search of youthful elixirs. They find doctors who will prescribe peptides and human growth hormone. The patients take all of these in hopes of adding muscle mass, smoothing wrinkles and reclaiming body definition and sexual vitality.Moorcones served both ends of this market, from athletes to the aging. All came to his online forum in search of the latest wonder drug.Moorcones purported that his products were intended for lab use only. In a 2014 email, he wrote: “I have the following batches available for in vitro purposes only. Peptides: Modified GRF (1-29) (2mg) @ $35/vial; $31/10 vials.” But a cursory reading of his customers’ online comments indicated that they were not being used that way.Dr. Todd B. Nippoldt, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., spoke to the scientific and health consequences of unregulated and illegal use.Advertisement“These people are carrying out quite sophisticated experiments on themselves at doses that far exceed anything in a lab,” Nippoldt said. “It’s quite remarkable and dangerous.”The original wonder drug of sports doping was steroids, and it remains the gold standard for athletic cheaters. There is nothing, doctors and athletes say, quite like the muscle-firing boost provided by synthetic testosterone.Steroid use peaked in the 1980s and 1990s, and records set during that era were Popeye-like. Olympic records usually fall every few Games; some records set during the steroid era have stood untouched for decades. This is no less true of Major League Baseball, where swollen sluggers made a mockery of the record books in recent decades.Then testing for steroids improved and some sports toughened their rules against doping. Steroids became a riskier play. But that did not stop cheating. Block one back alley, and sophisticated chemists scurry down another. The aim, always, is to find ways to build muscle mass, burn fat, aid recovery and increase the ability of the body to expand its aerobic capacity. This underground world soon turned its eyes toward human growth hormones and peptides, strings of amino acids and the building blocks of proteins.Some peptides trigger reactions in the body similar to those of anabolic steroids. Others, known as secretagogues, stimulate the human pituitary gland to release excess growth hormone. A well-regarded scientific study in Australia found that growth hormone helped sprinters improve their times by 4 percent. As a typical 100-meter race is won or lost by hundredths of a second, a 4 percent improvement would represent a considerable advantage.The Al Jazeera documentary underlined that peptides had become a prime ingredient in a cheater’s performance cocktail. The documentary caught Taylor Teagarden, a major league catcher, saying on hidden camera that he had taken peptides and never been caught. (Major League Baseball remedied that oversight and suspended Teagarden for 80 games a few months after the documentary was released.)Dr. Robert Salvatori, an expert on growth hormone at Johns Hopkins, noted that athletes were quite shrewd about the effects that drugs have on their bodies. History demonstrates that they often recognize the performance-boosting power before the medical community does.“It took scientists until 1996 to prove the muscle-boosting powers of steroids — which athletes knew years earlier,” he said. “We are running way behind.”AdvertisementSeeking to learn more about the latest tactics in sports doping, I went to Phoenix to meet with Cody Bidlow, a former professional sprinter and personal coach. A year ago, the United States Anti-Doping Agency discovered that Bidlow had ordered peptides from Moorcones’s website. He received a four-year suspension.A lean and muscular fellow, Bidlow described for me how he came to use peptides. He had been a sprinter at Grand Canyon University in 2015 when he sustained a hamstring injury. He was no potential Olympian. He simply wanted to run a few more races, so he asked around at elite gyms for a quick doping fix.“I had always been around people who used peptides and H.G.H.,” he said, although he declined to name names. “It sounded like peptides are super-effective.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.He wrote down the names of suppliers. He found a lot of fast talkers who excited no trust. (The head of Switzerland’s antidoping organization told me that his agency’s tests have shown that 80 percent of the peptides advertised on the web are adulterated or outright fakes.)Then Bidlow learned of Thomas Mann’s site, which was refreshingly professional. And Mann’s peptides were real. “This wasn’t ‘bro science’; he is a pure brainiac,” Bidlow said. “He would post scientific studies breaking down how a peptide worked.”We sat in a coffee shop as Bidlow gave me a tutorial on peptides. He described which worked, which were difficult to detect and which were not worth the trouble. He said coaches and athletes — particularly sprinters — were enamored of something called insulin-like growth factor-1, known as IGF-1. It promotes healing and builds muscle in a fashion similar to anabolic steroids. IGF-1 occurs naturally in the body, and antidoping tests struggle to distinguish the natural from the synthetic.No sprinter or baseball player has ever tested positive for IGF-1. Do not take that to mean no sprinter or baseball player has ever used it; they just haven’t been caught.The antidoping world has occasional successes. In 2015 and 2016, Dodgers pitcher Josh Ravin, Indians outfielder Marlon Byrd and Braves pitcher Andrew McKirahan tested positive for peptides. Major League Baseball suspended all of them.But the case of the retired baseball star Alex Rodriguez is more typical. Anthony Bosch, who said he supplied Rodriguez with drugs, told “60 Minutes” that his witch’s brew included peptides. Rodriguez was suspended by baseball, but not because he failed a drug test. The league connected him to doping through an investigation it started only after a news report broke the story of Bosch’s company, Biogenesis.Faced with the limits of testing technology, antidoping officials and investigators have asked the Food and Drug Administration and Congress to tighten laws and crack down on peptides and growth hormone.AdvertisementFor Drug Enforcement Administration officials, the problem lies with the weak wording of the laws that currently govern peptides.“If I catch you with heroin, it’s a controlled substance and illegal — that’s easy,” said Douglas W. Coleman, the special agent in charge of the D.E.A.’s Phoenix Division. “If I find human growth hormone, I have to build a case to show that it’s significantly outside what it can be prescribed for.“Peptides are more difficult still. There’s really no legal foothold.”The F.D.A. holds clearer regulatory authority; its officials could write tougher regulatory language and crack down on peptides and growth hormone. But agency investigators have paid scant attention to this black market. I asked, repeatedly and over many weeks, to speak with an F.D.A. official about the regulation of peptides and growth hormone.In the end, an agency spokeswoman sent a boilerplate email.“The F.D.A. takes seriously its mission to protect the health of the American public,” wrote the spokeswoman, Theresa Eisenman. “There are many complex factors involved in how cases involving the sale or distribution of illegal products are investigated and ultimately prosecuted.”Her email cited three successful peptide prosecutions involving four people during the past three years. Each of the offenders received a light punishment.Seeking a more detailed explanation, I called a former top F.D.A. official. He spoke on condition of anonymity, as he remains involved with these issues in the private sector. He described the F.D.A.’s stance as defensible. It has a small staff of about 200 agents, and they focus on plagues like tainted and counterfeit drugs, which endanger thousands of unsuspecting customers. The societal impact of peptides and growth hormone is far less severe, clearly.The former official described the world of illicit peptide and hormones as caveat emptor — buyer beware. “If rich patients and athletes are going to anti-aging clinics or the web in search of unregistered drugs, they know the risk,” he said.AdvertisementThe decision to downgrade prosecutions has all but decriminalized the mass distribution and use of powerful and untested drugs for athletes.That deeply frustrates those who are trying to stamp out chemical cheating by athletes. Jeff Novitzky once served as a top investigator for the Food and Drug Administration, and he was the lead investigator in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative case, in which he helped uncover doping by some of the biggest names in American sports.Novitzky now is a senior official with Ultimate Fighting Championship, the mixed-martial arts circuit. He is charged with cleaning up that sport, and sees governmental foot-dragging everywhere he looks.“For officials to complain that these are difficult, high-pressure prosecutions is a cowardly excuse,” Novitzky said. “The ease with which athletes, teenagers, anyone, can purchase and buy these powerful hormonal substances is mind-boggling.”Investigators discovered that Moorcones was shipping his products from a U.P.S. store wedged between a supermarket and real estate office on the suburban frontier of Queen Creek. Video surveillance revealed that Moorcones’s septuagenarian parents often went with him to mail his parcels.Eventually investigators obtained Moorcones’s customer list of more than 8,000 names. It was a rich hunting ground. Investigators found the names of pro athletes and forwarded the information to their leagues.Major League Baseball ended up suspending two minor leaguers. The National Football League was another matter. The Al Jazeera documentary had named six players as likely dopers, and the N.F.L. penalized not a single one. The Moorcones investigation yielded more names, which were shared with the league. The N.F.L. has penalized none of the players.Track and field athletes, weight lifters and wrestlers are another matter. The United States Anti-Doping Agency has jurisdiction over these sports and can punish athletes who violate doping protocols.AdvertisementUsada handed down a raft of penalties to Moorcones’s customers. Jason Young, a 35-year-old discus thrower and coach from Lubbock, Tex., who competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, was suspended, as was Nick Mossberg, a pole-vaulter who competed at the 2012 United States Olympic trials and planned to try again in 2016. The investigation also netted a wrestler from Colorado and a weight lifter who graduated from M.I.T.All acknowledged ordering peptides from Tom Mann. None of these athletes had tested positive.Bidlow and Mossberg, the pole-vaulter, had worked and trained at Altis, an elite athletic training campus in Phoenix. Numerous Olympic athletes train there under the tutelage of coaches with global reputations.I called the recruiting director at Altis, Andreas Behm, who also coaches the sprinters and hurdlers. Bidlow and Mossberg, he said, had simply “gone rogue.” The elite training center, he insisted, had no larger problem with doping.The investigation of Moorcones stalled last year. The United States attorney in Phoenix had taken a hard look and given up because a federal agency — the F.D.A. or the D.E.A. — was not willing to bring a case. His distribution of peptides, they apparently decided, was not worth prosecuting. A lawyer for Moorcones demanded immunity for his client.Moorcones shut down his website and claimed online that he was ill. Worried customers speculated that his own drugs had sickened him. “I feel for the guy,” one customer wrote. “The community of illegal experimental medicine is losing a true hero.”Other clients speculated correctly that Mann was under investigation; they began to worry that their names had fallen into the hands of law enforcement. They were correct.Moorcones politely bid everyone goodbye. “I’ve enjoyed serving everyone through the years,” he wrote on his Authentiquevie site.Within months, investigators noticed that one of Moorcones’s prominent, high-volume customers had taken his business to a dealer in Florida, where anti-aging clinics peddling peptides and hormones grow like sugar cane. Other clients turned to an oft-investigated but still active peptide trafficker in Louisiana.AdvertisementThere was still much investigators did not understand about Moorcones’s operation. He distributed such massive volumes of illicit substances, but they were never able to determine the source of the drugs. Was he purchasing them from somewhere and reselling to athletes, or was he somehow manufacturing them himself? And were his parents aware of what they were shipping?Back on the edge of the desert in Arizona, I persuaded Moorcones to keep the door open another minute or two. “People all have their own agenda,” he told me.I allowed that this might be true. Any story grows more complicated when you hear both sides, I said. Why not tell me yours?He smiled faintly. “I wouldn’t be the person to give it to you anyway. Thank you.”This time, Moorcones shut the door.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.Go to Home Page »"

Dr. David Agus is a best-selling author and physician whose clients included Steve Jobs and Sumner Redstone.Of all the companies the two could have started together, they’ve chosen an unusual approach: a hydroponic farming start-up focused on creating more healthful food.AdvertisementTheir new business, Sensei, formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon, wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors.AdvertisementSilicon Valley Start-up Plenty raised $200 million from SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund. Bowery Farming, whose vegetables are now sold in a few grocery stores in New York City, has collected money from the likes of Google’s venture arm and General Catalyst.Sensei is focused more on wellness. While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses, its initial focus is on hydroponic farming, using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions. (Its first farm is on Lanai, the Hawaiian island of which Mr. Ellison owns roughly 98 percent.)Sensei’s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.“So far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,” Dr. Agus said in a statement. “To properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.”Its first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.“For so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,” Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei’s president, said in a statement. “Now, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.”Advertisement— Michael de la MercedFacebook’s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world’s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry’s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook’s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.“We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group.Facebook’s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index’s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday’s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Fund flows added fuel to the selloff. MoneyBeat’s Akane Otani reports that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds tracking U.S. technology stocks posted a record $2.6 billion in net inflows last week, according to data from fund tracker EPFR Global. That put year-to-date inflows at $47.5 billion.“The record-setting stream of money into stock funds has underlined how much the market has been driven by investor fervor for a handful of popular names, which some say makes stocks vulnerable to sudden reversals.”AdvertisementGiven the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 336 points, or 1.35 percent, while the S.&P. 500, was off nearly 39 points, or 1.42 percent.Is Mark Zuckerberg’s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?The giant social media company is under the spotlight because a political data firm apparently misused information about more than 50 million Facebook users. Facebook is still facing questions about Russia-linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network. In both cases, Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems. Information about the Russia-linked accounts came out piecemeal, and Facebook knew as early as 2015 that the political data firm had violated its data policies.Mr. Zuckerberg at first downplayed concerns about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election (something he later said he regretted). His recent communications contain more high-minded deliberation than hard discussion of the company’s problems and how to deal with them.These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company’s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook’s profitability. Indeed, there’s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg’s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it’s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook’s extraordinary profitability – its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue – will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.AdvertisementIf governments propose restrictions on using members’ data, Facebook’s business model would be tested. The company’s board, in theory, should press Mr. Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles. But prominent board members like Marc L. Andreessen and Peter A. Thiel are skeptical of regulation. Facebook might be tempted to fight back.Lawmakers may hold the line, however, sensing that the public has real concerns about the company. And if Facebook’s responses look tardy and inadequate, the consequences could be harsh, as the fate of Wells Fargo  shows. Mr. Zuckerberg, in his uniquely dominant position, is the one person who can make sure this doesn’t happen.— Peter EavisLawmakers in the U.S. and Britain want Mark Zuckerberg to explain how Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm founded by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer, harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.“It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” tweeted Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.What happened: The NYT and The Observer of London reported how Cambridge had collected data from an outside researcher to better target Facebook users. Christopher Wylie, who oversaw Cambridge’s data collection until 2014, told the NYT of his former company, “For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”Facebook argued that the incident wasn’t a data breach and that Cambridge had committed a violation. But former Federal Trade Commission officials told the WaPo that Facebook may have violated a privacy pact reached with the regulator. (The tech giant is reviewing whether one of its employees had been aware of the data leak.)More on Cambridge Analytica: Alexander Nix, the company’s chief, is facing scrutiny over business dealings with Russian interests. Mr. Wylie said that one Russian company, the oil giant Lukoil, appeared more interested in political message targeting than commercial uses. And Cambridge is reportedly trying to block the airing of a report by Channel 4, a British television channel, in which reporters went undercover at the firm.Critic’s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:“Facebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn’t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.”A woman in Tempe, Ariz., has died after being hit by a self-driving car operated by Uber, in what appears to be the first known death of a pedestrian struck by an autonomous vehicle on a public road.AdvertisementThe Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman, who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, the Tempe police said in a statement. The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.“Our hearts go out to the victim’s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,” an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.— Daisuke WakabayashiThe newspaper publisher announced Monday that Michael W. Ferro Jr., a Chicago entrepreneur and its biggest shareholder, has stepped down as the company’s chairman. The move came just weeks after Mr. Ferro helped negotiate the sale of Tronc’s crown jewel, The Los Angeles Times.Justin Dearborn, the company’s chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman.“I am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,” Mr. Ferro said in a statement.Mr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc. But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.— Sydney EmberThe Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.AdvertisementThe start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.The filing — which will commence the public part of the S.E.C.’s review of the rule changes at IEX — advances the LTSE’s aim of enshrining what it believes are best practices in running companies into corporate charters.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE’s founder, Eric Ries.It also formalizes a tie-up between LTSE and IEX, the exchange best known as the subject of Michael Lewis’s “Flash Boys.”Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.• LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt’s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.“What we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,” Mr. Ries said.— Michael de la MercedFriday is the deadline for lawmakers to pass a budget, and they are considering a plan that would cost more than $1 trillion. Expect the deficit to widen to more than $800 billion, as well as a lot of pet projects.The proposal will probably garner Democratic support, but opposition could come from: a) fiscal conservatives, and b) President Trump (if it includes funding for a New York tunnel project).AdvertisementIn related news: How the tax bill could make your credit card payments more expensive.Forty-five trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged President Trump not to move forward with sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods.Here’s what Thomas Donohue, the C.E.O. of the chamber, said:“The livelihood of America’s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.”Elsewhere in trade: Mr. Trump is requesting authority to unilaterally raise tariffs, power that could undermine the World Trade Organization.

Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.• He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone.

business,"AdvertisementWith Andrew Ross SorkinAPRIL 20, 2018
Good Friday morning. Here’s what we’re watching:• Wells Fargo takes another hit.• What AT&T’s Randall Stephenson said on the stand.• What Takeda has to weigh in its pursuit of Shire.Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here.President Trump took the unusual step of taking on oil prices on his favorite venue on Friday, tweeting his ire at OPEC. Oil prices fell soon after the tweet, with Brent crude posting its biggest intraday drop in weeks.But why has President Trump made the international oil cartel his latest bête noire? One potential reason: It makes life more difficult for many Americans, weighing on the benefits of the Republican tax cuts.The context: OPEC and Russia agreed two years ago to cut — and maintain — oil production caps to bring prices back up in the wake of U.S. shale boom. So far, that strategy has worked:With oil above $73 now, even after Mr. Trump’s tweet, fuel prices are at reaching two-year highs as the U.S. gets into the summer driving season. More importantly, Americans are preparing to spend more on fuel, eating into whatever savings they are expected to receive on average from the tax cuts.AdvertisementFrom Ed Crooks of the FT from earlier this week:Americans are expected to spend an average of $400 per household more on fuel this year than in 2016, as the rebound in crude prices is reflected in the cost of petrol at the pump. By contrast, middle-income US households will on average gain $930 each from the tax cut bill passed at the end of last year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.But as Mr. Crooks also notes, higher fuel prices are less of a burden than they used to be. And OPEC members appear to be taking Mr. Trump’s tweet in stride. Khalid Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, told Bloomberg, “We have seen prices significantly higher in the past, twice as much as where we are today,” and that the global economy has done fine.AdvertisementAnd Michael Lynch of Strategic Energy & Economic Research had this to say to Bloomberg:“Ninety-eight percent of what politicians say about oil should just be disregarded immediately and this falls in there.”The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into potential coordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, according to six people with knowledge of the inquiry.In February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said.Representatives for the Justice Department, AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A. declined to comment.— Cecilia KangShares of General Electric jumped nearly 4 percent Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and reaffirmed its guidance for the year.Though G.E. reported a first-quarter loss on Friday, there were also signs that the struggling industrial giant is beginning to stabilize its business.AdvertisementG.E.’s big power-generator division continues to drag down the company’s overall performance, and it is still burdened with financial liabilities that linger from the conglomerate’s pared-back finance arm, GE Capital.But G.E.’s other major industrial divisions, led by aviation and health care, delivered solid results in the quarter. That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines.Especially heartening for investors, G.E. reaffirmed its profit outlook for the year, predicting earnings per share of $1 to $1.07, though likely at the lower end of that range. Analysts had been skeptical that G.E. could do that well. The average analysts’ forecast for the year was 95 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.With Wells Fargo about to face a $1 billion fine over misdeeds like forcing customers to buy unnecessary auto insurance, Jim Stewart raises a provocative question: Is this too much punishment?To recap: Wells Fargo has already paid $185 million over its fake accounts scandal and set aside $4.25 billion for liabilities tied to other infractions. And the Fed has prevented the bank from expanding its balance sheet.Yes, the upcoming $1 billion fine is the most stringent bank penalty imposed by the Trump administration to date. (The C.F.P.B., under pressure from Mick Mulvaney to go easier on financial firms, is involved here.)But Mr. Stewart writes, “At this point it’s hard to imagine what more Wells Fargo can do (or how much more it can spend) to make amends.”Elsewhere in banking: British financial regulators fined Barclays’s C.E.O., Jes Staley, over his efforts to identify a whistle-blower. Deutsche Bank mistakenly paid $35 billion to Deutsche Börse. (It got the money back.)AdvertisementThat’s the contention of the reporter Jonathan Greenberg, who, as a Forbes reporter in 1984, spoke with “John Barron” about Donald Trump’s net worth. Mr. Barron — a now well-known alter ego of the real estate executive — contended that Mr. Trump had bought out most of his father’s stake in their business.From Mr. Greenberg’s op-ed in the WaPo:Over time I have learned that he should not have been on the first three Forbes 400 lists at all. In our first-ever list, in 1982, we included him at $100 million, but Trump was actually worth roughly $5 million — a paltry sum by the standards of his super-monied peers — as a spate of government reports and books showed only much later.Mr. Greenberg writes that the White House and the Trump Organization declined to comment.On the stand yesterday, Randall Stephenson argued that his company’s planned takeover of Time Warner would create a business no different from the Silicon Valley giants AT&T sees as its rivals. “The FAANG are all focused on premium video,” Mr. Stephenson said. “All of them are vertically integrated.”The Justice Department, which wants to block the deal, argued that AT&T is different because it’s also a broadband internet provider, and that relations with Silicon Valley are chummier than Mr. Stephenson asserts.Andrew says: If you read one smart thing today, make it this thread by Matthew Ball, the former head of strategy at Amazon Studios. This point is especially insightful:Elsewhere in big media: CBS investors can continue their lawsuit over whether Sumner Redstone was improperly enriched through compensation the board gave him after his health issues made it difficult to function.After what briefly looked like a potential bidding war between Takeda and Allergan — until Allergan dropped out — the question now, Michael writes, is what price will Shire fetch? (Takeda has informally offered over $60 billion.)A big takeover would give Takeda more scale — the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales — and a bigger international footprint. But it would also be the company’s biggest takeover by far, and perhaps too expensive.The Japanese drug maker said it intended to maintain its credit rating, which could be difficult if it bids too high — or is pressured to do so by yet another suitor.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.Critics’ corner: Neil Unmack and Robert Cyran of Breakingviews say Takeda needs a deal, but risks overpaying. Chris Hughes and Max Nisen of Gadfly aren’t sure a bidding war for Shire is warranted.AdvertisementElsewhere in deals:  WPP pushed back against calls to break itself up. Qualcomm needs a better Plan B if its NXP takeover fails. Connecticut Water has rejected a $748 million takeover bid by Eversource. Saudi Arabia’s solar project deal with SoftBank exposed infighting between the kingdom’s energy ministry and its sovereign wealth fund.With its $16 trillion economy and reputation for tough negotiating, the E.U. could have been the immovable object in President Trump’s trade fight. But that is looking less likely, Peter Eavis writes.Why? The WSJ reports that the E.U. is prepared to offer concessions to avoid Mr. Trump’s threatened tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that Mr. Trump has threatened — perhaps reducing tariffs on American cars and industrial parts, and joining the U.S. in pressuring China on trade and investment rules.Among the lessons if the E.U. concedes: The U.S.’s large trade deficits can give it leverage.Beijing appears keenly aware of the risks here and is sure to press its case at a China-E.U. summit in July.Elsewhere in trade: Global policymakers in Washington for I.M.F. and World Bank meetings appear worried about a trade war. The Export-Import Bank has been sidelined despite its potential usefulness in trade fights. And how a Chinese boycott of U.S. goods could backfire.• Rudy Giuliani and two other former federal prosecutors have joined President Trump’s legal team to “quickly” resolve Robert Mueller’s investigation. Rod Rosenstein reportedly told Mr. Trump that he’s not a target in either the Mueller investigation or the case involving Michael Cohen.• The F.B.I. has released James Comey’s memos about his interactions with Mr. Trump, one of which recorded the president expressing frustration with Michael Flynn. The Justice Department’s internal watchdog referred its findings about Andrew McCabe to prosecutors.• The Republican fund-raiser Elliott Broidy pushed for Mr. Trump to meet with the Malaysian prime minister, who was under investigation from U.S. prosecutors — and had business dealings with Mr. Broidy.

(WSJ)The sometimes controversial data consultant cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the C.I.A. Now it’s hoping that its latest product will attract more commercial clients.But here’s the company's biggest problem, according to Bloomberg’s Peter Waldman, Lizette Chapman and Jordan Robertson:The company needs to figure out how to be rewarded on Wall Street without creeping out Main Street. It might not be possible. For all of Palantir’s professed concern for individuals’ privacy, the single most important safeguard against abuse is the one it’s trying desperately to reduce through automation: human judgment.Now might not seem the ideal time to start a venture capital firm that aims to help U.S. start-ups break into the Russian market. But Fort Ross Ventures, which has opened for business in the U.S. with a $200 million fund, is making a go of it.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross’s founder and managing partner, told Michael that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm’s ability to operate. “The nature of start-ups is all about risk,” he said. “There is a political tension, but not when you’re talking to start-ups.”The tech flyaround• A PWC audit of Facebook last year found sufficient data privacy protections, despite the Cambridge Analytica incident.

business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Deborah B. Solomon and Kitty BennettPresident Trump has a new chief economic adviser. Larry Kudlow, the CNBC commentator who served in President Ronald Reagan’s Office of Management and Budget, will become the director of the National Economic Council, a position being vacated by Gary D. Cohn, who said he would resign after losing an internal battle over the president’s plan to impose tariffs on foreign metals. Mr. Kudlow, often on-air and with a flair for provocative punditry, has prognosticated on many economic and political issues in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president’s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark. The following is a look back at some of his economic predictions that did not bear out.“Homebuilders led the stock parade this week with a fantastic 11 percent gain. This is a group that hedge funds and bubbleheads love to hate. All the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.” — June, 2005Analysis: Well, we all know what happened. By 2008, the housing bubble popped, home prices were in a free-fall and the mortgage-backed securities that banks had loaded up on were threatening to plunge those firms — and the economy — into the abyss. Home prices in 20 metropolitan areas across the country dropped at a record rate of 18 percent in October 2008 from a year earlier as the fallout from the financial collapse reverberated through the housing market. The housing market has still not recovered completely or evenly and prices in many cities are still below their pre-recession peak.“What’s even more incredible is Team Obama’s stubborn refusal to have any faith in the free market. In some of the hardest hit areas of the country, markets are already solving the housing problem.If the government really wants to help, instead of bailing out irresponsible mortgage holders, it should support new and younger families who want to buy starter homes and begin to climb the ladder of prosperity.All this is free-market economics 101. And I say, let free-markets work.” — February, 2009Analysis: The Obama administration’s plan to help homeowners included a litany of programs, including reducing the debt that distressed borrowers owed. The success of these programs was mixed but recent studies show that they did, in fact, help millions of people stay in their homes.Mr. Kudlow’s claim that the markets were already “solving” the housing problem was not accurate, given that the housing market still has not recovered in many areas, including those hardest hit. In 2009, banks were — and in many cases remain — incredibly reluctant to make loans to all but the highest-quality borrowers. That does not generally include new and younger families, who have little credit history and are considered riskier than those with a track record of on-time payments. Without the government assisting borrowers who were in danger of foreclosure, the economic fallout from the crisis would have been even deeper, more severe and longer-lasting.“At home in the U.S., there are still housing-slump worries and concerns about an inventory correction in autos and factories. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan this week even predicted a recession, naming the budget deficit as the cause. Huh? The deficit is evaporating as record tax revenues are being generated by a solid economy, itself a function of the low marginal tax rates put in place by President Bush.” — March, 2007Analysis: That solid economy was not so solid after all and Mr. Greenspan’s prediction of a recession came true. By December 2007, the United States was officially in the Great Recession. The budget deficit did not evaporate but ballooned and continues to grow today, with the nation approaching a $1 trillion annual deficit.“Recessions are therapeutic. They cleanse excess from the economy. Think about excessive risk speculation, leverage, and housing. Recessions are curative: They restore balance and create the foundation for the next recovery. Despite the housing and credit problem and the sub-prime virus, banks are still lending to businesses. So we don’t have a genuine credit crunch across the board. That is very good.” — April, 2008Analysis: Recessions do help reduce leverage — or debt — that households and businesses have since loans are no longer easy to come by and creditors demand repayment of past debts. But Mr. Kudlow’s “credit crunch” assessment was flawed. Households and businesses did face a real “credit crunch” as banks retrenched and restricted lending to all but the most sterling borrowers. “There's no question that President Clinton's across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy's long-run potential to grow.” — March, 1993Analysis: The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time and there was not a single bear market or dip. The so-called dot com bubble helped fuel that rise until it all came crashing down in the spring of 2000, a situation created by speculation rather than Washington’s economic policies.“And let’s not forget: The stock market, which is a leading indicator of the future economy, is in a wee bit of a correction. Given the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven’t plunged. Trump’s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth. It’s like Fortress America in an economy that is completely globalized and where the U.S. must compete in the worldwide race for capital and labor. Trump’s policies don’t fit.” — August, 2015Analysis: President Trump was elected and the stock market has only climbed. While there have been moments of volatility and days that ended in the red, the United States is still experiencing a bull market — stocks were up more than 300 percent at their peak in late January. It’s a financial metric that his new boss is quite fond of citing and taking credit for.Emily Baumgaertner contributed research. AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy James B. StewartFew investors had more at stake in Broadcom’s $117 billion hostile takeover bid for the chip maker Qualcomm than Jerome L. Dodson, the founder and chief executive of Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, and chief portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor mutual fund.Endeavor owns 8.3 million Qualcomm shares, making it one of the company’s largest shareholders. A week ago the shares were worth over $500 million and accounted for nearly 10 percent of Endeavor’s assets, a highly concentrated position.By pursuing a mix of value and socially responsible investing — avoiding companies that harm the environment, and favoring companies that treat their employees well — Mr. Dodson has emerged as one of his generation’s most successful investors. Morningstar ranks his Endeavor fund first among large capitalization blended mutual funds over 10-, five- and three-year periods.Then, this week, President Trump killed Broadcom’s takeover bid on national security grounds, and Qualcomm shares plunged. They dropped more than 5 percent on Tuesday, a $25 million hit to the Endeavor fund.Yet when I spoke to Mr. Dodson this week, he was not only serenely unruffled by the president’s decision — he applauded it.“There’s no doubt I would have made a quick profit if the Broadcom deal had gone through,” he said. “But as a shareholder, I voted against it.”That’s partly because, “as a citizen, I didn’t like the deal,” he said. Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. “In the long run that’s not good for the country or for society,” Mr. Dodson said.He agreed with the Trump administration’s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm’s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm’s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm’s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm’s business model and Apple’s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm’s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom’s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson’s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, “which is why Broadcom’s offer didn’t really engage my attention,” he said.That, however, is a big “if,” given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset — and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.Apple has called the arrangement an “extortion scheme.” It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones’ distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven’t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.In Mr. Dodson’s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.Still, “I’d like to see them budge” on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. “I can see Apple’s point.”But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device’s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them.A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea’s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm.Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm’s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm’s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.Qualcomm’s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson’s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund’s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.Still, Qualcomm’s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it’s 61st.Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects — and share price — will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn’t mean he’s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: “Why doesn’t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.”“As a citizen, I’d be very comfortable with that,” he said.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersOSLO — Budget carrier Norwegian Air remains confident of its business model, its CEO told shareholders on Tuesday, less than a week after the company said it had rejected two takeover proposals from British Airways owner IAG.London-listed IAG last month took a 4.6 percent stake in the airline, which in turn triggered interest from other suitors, according to earlier statements from Norwegian's board.""Acquisition interest from several parties confirms the sustainability of the business model,"" Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos told the company's annual shareholder meeting.Loss-making Norwegian is in the midst of a massive transatlantic expansion aimed at turning around the company's fortunes by replicating the low-cost model that worked for European flights.Analysts on average expect the airline's revenue to grow by an 84 percent between 2017 and 2020 to 56.9 billion Norwegian crowns (5.2 billion pounds), according to I/B/E/S forecasts on Thomson Reuters Eikon.While the company is expected to post a net loss of 650 million crowns in the current year, the analysts forecast a profit of 723 million crowns in 2019 and 1.2 billion crowns the following year.

Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching today:• Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down?• The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing.• When will wage growth pick up?• Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi.• How much is Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang album worth?• The Trump tariffs have many exceptions..Don’t already get this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.AdvertisementThe Wall Street Journal reported that Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, will step down “as soon as the end of the year,” citing anonymous sources.AdvertisementBut some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned.Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018?Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said.Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019?Sure, these people said. But that’s not a certainty either.Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020? That’s less likely, these people agree. Goldman’s board has held discussions about who should succeed Mr. Blankfein ever since Gary Cohn left the firm at the end of 2016, these people said. The board has designated Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon as likely successors, but has not set a specific date for when they need to decide on who will take the reins, these people said. Both men have privately been making plans to take over, these people said.— Andrew Ross SorkinHere’s Mr. Blankfein’s response to the WSJ story:
            It's the @WSJ's announcement...not mine. I feel like Huck Finn listening to his own eulogy.        The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road.In fact, even before signing the order, he suggested the possibility of later excluding allies like Australia.Well, that seems like more of possibility now.Late Friday President Trump said he is working with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on an agreement so Australia will not be subject to the tariffs.
            Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia!        The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel “is considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom’s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.”AdvertisementThose options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources.Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours.Details from the WSJ• Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose.• Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers.• Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm.Caveats• Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ’s sources said it is unlikely.ContextWashington isn’t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions’ national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of QualcommThe panel’s intervention put Broadcom’s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals.MARCH 9, 2018
The February jobs report is in. The number of jobs added was the strongest in two years, but wage growth remained lackluster.AdvertisementHere are the numbers:• 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000.• With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month.• The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January.• The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.• The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark.MARCH 9, 2018
ContextA leap in job gains in February clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets this month.The wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January — which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier — was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February’s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.MARCH 9, 2018
Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday’s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.AdvertisementThe economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren’t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.
            Monster household survey this month: 800k gain in labor force, participation rate and employment-population ratio both up 0.3 percentage points.        But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won’t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn’t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.— Peter EavisIt’s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.Maybe we can shed some light.As Friday’s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.But how long might wage growth remain moderate? Much depends on how much slack exists in the jobs market. The headline unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, suggests there is very little.But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce – and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers — and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.AdvertisementBut our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate – and why did you make your tweaks?Let me start with the “why?” The employment rate is great in that it avoids all the issues that bedevil the unemployment rate in terms of deciding who should “count” as unemployed. But the problem is that it’s too broad. It includes a huge group of people who no one would expect to work, namely retirees. And that group is growing rapidly because baby boomers are aging. So if we want the employment rate to tell us anything meaningful about the state of the economy, we have to account for that big demographic trend in some way.One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called “prime-age” workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, “What would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?”What does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it’s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?Yes, but it doesn’t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn’t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons — technology, globalization, video games — the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.AdvertisementIf you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we’re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don’t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today’s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.• Joseph Song and Michelle Meyer, BofA Merrill Lynch: Today’s “Goldilocks” report suggests the business cycle still has another leg to go: the labor supply is increasing to meet the gain aggregate demand, preventing price pressures from building too aggressively.• Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley: Straight lines don’t exist in economics. Despite the move lower in the year-over-year pace of average hourly earnings (AHE), the underlying trend in wage growth continues to firm, in line with continued tightening in the labor market and rising productivity.• Joe Brusuelas, RSM US: “The job market continues to sizzle as the economy is in the early stages of absorbing a late cycle fiscal boost that will support a growth rate well above the long-term trend in 2018. The 313,000 job gain is more than triple that necessary to meet the demand of new entrants into the work force, which if it sustained will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate. This will not be lost among an F.O.M.C. that leans hawkish in 2018 and points toward an increasing probability that the central bank will hike rates four times this year. How strong is this labor market? The increase of 806,000 in the labor force and 785,000 in the household employment estimate are robust and statistically significant, which is a rare two-for in the monthly labor report. This labor market is on fire and wage gains are in train.”• James Ingram, MB Capital: “February’s fall in average wage rise data takes some of the pressure off. But the creation of more than 300,000 jobs in February suggests it will return in the months to come. Throw in a potential trade war between the US and the EU and the US economy could be headed for a perfect inflationary storm later this year. An interest rate hike in March from the US Fed must now be all but nailed on.”Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The jury found that he had also secretly controlled a huge number of Retrophin shares.Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months.Ben Sisario of the NYT writes:When Martin Shkreli, the disgraced former pharmaceuticals executive, is sentenced for securities fraud in Brooklyn on Friday, the government will have its pick of a number of his assets to satisfy the $7.36 million judgmentagainst him.There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso.And then there is an item that has been the subject of worldwide intrigue: the sole copy of the Wu-Tang Clan album “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,”packaged in a custom silver-and-nickel case and accompanied by a 174-page leather-bound book.

But as Peter Eavis notes, the presence of exemptions for Canada and Mexico show more wiggle room than expected:Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs.And Neil Irwin of the Upshot reckons that while we’re seeing a trade skirmish, it won’t necessarily become a trade war.

business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The nation’s largest cities and metropolitan areas — home to a majority of Democratic voters — are at the forefront of the party’s most vexing racial, ethnic and class conflicts.Last week, in an essay for CityLab, Richard Florida, a professor of urban planning at the University of Toronto, described how housing costs are driving the growing division between upwardly and downwardly mobile populations within Democratic ranks:The rise in housing inequality brings us face to face with a central paradox of today’s increasingly urbanized form of capitalism. The clustering of talent, industry, investment, and other economic assets in small parts of cities and metropolitan areas is at once the main engine of economic growth and the biggest driver of inequality. The ability to buy and own housing, much more than income or any other source of wealth, is a significant factor in the growing divides between the economy’s winners and losers.Allies on Election Day, the two wings of the Democratic Party are growing further estranged in other aspects of their lives, driven apart by the movement of advantaged and disadvantaged populations within and between cities. These demographic patterns exacerbate intraparty tensions.Florida, writing with Benjamin Schneider of CityLab, expands on this point:While the advantaged members of the knowledge, professional, and creative class have enough money left over even after paying the cost of housing in these cities, it’s the less-well-paid members of the service and working classes who get the short end of the stick, with not nearly enough left over to afford the basic necessities of life. They are either pushed to the periphery of these places or pushed out altogether.The competition for housing between rich and poor has become a critically important and divisive issue in urban America.“The state of housing affordability in the expensive coastal metros is driving a wedge between two factions of the American left,” Issi Romem, a fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an email to me.In a paper published earlier this month, “Characteristics of Domestic Cross-Metropolitan Migrants,” Romem looked at the income and education levels of families moving in and out of 441 metropolitan areas. He found thatDomestic migration across U.S. metropolitan areas is selective: in-migrants to expensive metros tend to have higher incomes and educational attainment than out-migrants, while the opposite is true in the least expensive metros. This pattern contributes to the process of polarization across U.S. metros.One of the most expensive metropolitan areas in the country, San Francisco, is also one of the most Democratic sections of the country, (San Francisco County: Clinton 84.5 percent, Trump 9.2 percent). According to Romem, between 2005 and 2016, those moving into the San Francisco area had median household incomes averaging $12,639 a year more than the households of the families moving out, $70,015 to $57,376.Conversely, in the struggling Syracuse metropolitan area (Clinton 53.9 percent, Trump 40.1 percent), families moving in between 2005 and 2016 had median household incomes of $35,219 — $7,229 less than the median income of the families moving out of the region, $42,448.Research that focuses on the way city neighborhoods are changing by income, race and ethnicity, while not specifically addressed to political consequences, helps us see the potential for conflict within the Democratic coalition.Robert J. Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard, published a detailed study in 2015 for the St. Louis Federal Reserve of the economic composition of neighborhoods. Overall, he found, “middle-income neighborhoods are tenuous,” while neighborhoods at the top and bottom of the economic ladder have remained strikingly stable.For example, as Sampson explained by email,fully 80 percent of all U.S. neighborhoods in the top income quintile remained in place between 2000 and 2012. In Los Angeles, the persistence rate reached 87 percent among the highest income quintile neighborhoods. In Chicago 82 percent of the affluent neighborhoods in 2000 remained in place over the decade.Chicago, Sampson wrote, is “experiencing a concentrated affluence shift,” in whichthe black population has declined and Hispanics are now second largest after whites in population. The race/ethnic shift is something of a milestone given the history of the city.Despite this shift, Chicago remains reliably Democratic. In 2016, Clinton beat Trump there 83.7 percent to 12.5 percent.In firmly Democratic neighborhoods across the country, the economic status of those moving in and out began to shift radically starting at the beginning of this century.Take, for example, “Accounting for Central Neighborhood Change, 1980-2010,” by Nathaniel Baum-Snow, an economist at the University of Toronto, and Daniel Hartley, an economist at the Federal Reserve in Chicago. They found that the core of the nation’s cities is being taken over by members of the affluent wing of the Democratic Party at the expense of the less affluent, disproportionately minority wing of the party:Central neighborhoods of most U.S. metropolitan areas experienced population decline 1980-2000 and population growth 2000-2010. 1980-2000 departures of residents without a college degree accounted for most of the decline while the return of college educated whites and the stabilization of neighborhood choices by less educated whites drove most of the post-2000 rebound.Baum-Snow and Hartley cite what they call “a shifting balance between departures of low SES (socioeconomic status) minorities and inflows of high SES whites” and point out that neighborhoods surrounding cities’ central business districts have experienced a turnarounddriven by the return of college-graduate and high-income whites to these neighborhoods, coupled with a halt in the outflows of other white demographic groups. At the same time, the departures of minorities without college degrees continued unabated.In Chicago, Baum-Snow and Hartley point out, the largely minority census tracts that gained whites the fastest from 1980 to 2010 were “almost exclusively within 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) of the central business district.”A similar pattern has emerged in the urban West. “Gentrification in the Bay Area, Portland and Seattle,” Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, told me in an email, “is definitely pushing disadvantaged populations out of old neighborhoods and into far-flung exurbs.”Within major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Cain continued,the sorting is also between neighborhoods, with large nonwhite populations surrounded by white/Asian suburbs, and certain Latinos and Asians displacing blacks.Upscale liberal whites “who consider themselves committed to racial justice” tend to be “NIMBYists when it comes to their neighborhoods,” Cain wrote, “not living up to their affordable housing commitments and resisting apartment density around mass transportation stops.”“One of the key problems of the information/digital economy,” according to Cain,is that it thrives under conditions of amassing large concentrations of human and financial capital, which results in these homogeneous bubbles. It doesn’t help that many of the tech workers are not as inclined to be good neighbors.The trends Cain cites are part of a nationwide shift.From the 1960s and 1970s to 2000, Florida pointed out by email, the basic pattern wasblacks were moving into and staying in cities, and whites were moving out. But in the period since 2000, and earlier than that for very successful cities like New York, San Francisco, Boston, Washington D.C., and Seattle, affluent white highly educated people begin to move in, and less educated whites and particularly less educated and less affluent blacks begin moving out.As intraparty economic and racial divisions have increased within the Democratic coalition, the political power of the well-to-do has grown at the expense of racial and ethnic minorities.Right now, a heated conflict has erupted within Democratic ranks in California over pending legislation (SB 827) that would override local zoning laws to allow developers to exceed height and density limits in return for an agreement to include more affordable housing units near transit hubs.In very liberal Marin County (Clinton 77.3 percent, Trump 15.5 percent, median household income $100,310), elected officials of at least seven local municipalities have voted to oppose the legislation.Jonathan Chait, writing in New York Magazine on Wednesday, pointed out that the housing issue in California and elsewhere,is ultimately a question of whether the most prosperous parts of blue America can be opened up to new entrants, or whether they will remain closed off and increasingly unaffordable. It is also a political test for whether progressives will be manipulated by knee-jerk suspicions, or be able to think clearly about using the market to serve human needs.After overwhelmingly Democratic City Councils along the California coast voted to oppose the legislation, the Democratic State Senate answered Chait’s question and killed the bill.The maneuvers in California are a reflection of a larger problem for Democrats: their inability to reconcile the conflicts inherent in the party’s economic and racial bifurcation.Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard, addressed the Democrats’ dilemma in a recent essay for Project Syndicate:In principle, greater inequality produces a demand for more redistribution. Democratic politicians should respond by imposing higher taxes on the wealthy and spending the proceeds on the less well off.In practice, Rodrik writesdemocracies have moved in the opposite direction. The progressivity of income taxes has decreased, reliance on regressive consumption taxes has increased, and the taxation of capital has followed a global race to the bottom. Instead of boosting infrastructure investment, governments have pursued austerity policies that are particularly harmful to low-skill workers. Big banks and corporations have been bailed out, but households have not. In the United States, the minimum wage has not been adjusted sufficiently, allowing it to erode in real terms.Why?Rodrik cites the work of the French economist Thomas Piketty, who argues that political parties on the left have been taken over, here and in Europe, “by the well-educated elite” — what Piketty calls the “Brahmin Left.” The Brahmin Left, writes Rodrik,is not friendly to redistribution, because it believes in meritocracy — a world in which effort gets rewarded and low incomes are more likely to be the result of insufficient effort than poor luck.Michael Lind, a professor of public policy at the University of Texas in Austin, wrote in a prescient 2014 essay, “The Coming Realignment: Cities, Class, and Ideology After Social Conservatism,” that “high-density downtowns and suburban villages are coming to have an hourglass-shaped social structure.”“Wealthy individuals” are at the top, according to Lind, with a “large luxury-service proletariat at the bottom.” Democrats, in this scheme, have become the party ofthe downtown and edge city elites and their supporting staff of disproportionately foreign-born, low-wage service workers.Lind’s point raises a fundamental question for the Democratic Party: Can it find a way to hold its “hourglass-shaped” political coalition together?Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, predicted the potential political developments of this situation in an article in March 2016:Over the next decade or so, the Republicans will split between their growing nationalist-populist wing and their business establishment wing, a split that the nationalist-populist wing will eventually win. The Democrats will face a similar split between the increasingly pro-corporate but socially liberal Clinton wing and a more economically progressive Sanders wing, a split that the Clinton wing will eventually win.The outcome?The Democrats will become the party of urban cosmopolitan business liberalism, and the Republicans will become the party of suburban and rural nationalist populism.Clearly, the 2016 election demonstrated the fragility of the Democratic coalition and its vulnerability to challenge from the populist right.Dani Rodrik picks up this point in his Project Syndicate essay:Why were democratic political systems not responsive early enough to the grievances that autocratic populists have successfully exploited — inequality and economic anxiety, decline of perceived social status, the chasm between elites and ordinary citizens? Had political parties, particularly of the center left, pursued a bolder agenda, perhaps the rise of right-wing, nativist political movements might have been averted.The forces behind the conversion of the Democratic Party into “the party of urban cosmopolitan business liberalism,” as described by Drutman, may be inexorable. If so, Rodrik’s call on the center-left to adopt a “bolder agenda” may be beyond reach.Taking it a step further, a Democratic Party based on urban cosmopolitan business liberalism runs the risk not only of leading to the continued marginalization of the minority poor, but also — as the policies of the Trump administration demonstrate — to the continued neglect of the white working-class electorate that put Trump in the White House.In other words, Democratic strategists looking to piece together a 21st century political alliance have to consider the unintended consequences of taking the easy route: constructing a coalition explicitly dominated by elites.I say easy because — compared to the average resident of the United States — the affluent are “vastly more engaged politically,” as Douglas S. Massey and Jacob S. Rugh, sociologists at Princeton and Brigham Young University, write in a forthcoming paper, “Isolation at the Extremes”:Whereas 99 percent of the wealthy voted in the 2012 presidential election and 60 percent gave money to a political candidate, the corresponding figures were just 78 percent and 18 percent for Americans in general. As a result, the affluent are far more likely to have their political preferences reflected in public policies than other Americans.The force that had historically pushed policy to the economic left — organized labor — has for the most part been marginalized. African-American and Hispanic voters have shown little willingness to join Democratic reform movements led by upper middle class whites, as shown in their lack of enthusiasm for Bill Bradley running against Al Gore in 2000 or Sanders running against Clinton in 2016.The hurdle facing those seeking to democratize elite domination of the Democratic Party is finding voters and donors who have a sustained interest in redistributive policies — and the minimum wage is only a small piece of this. Achieving that goal requires an economically coherent center-left political coalition. It also requires the ability to overcome the seemingly insuperable political divisions between the white working class and the African-American and Hispanic working classes — that elusive but essential multiracial — and now multiethnic — majority. Establishing that majority in a coherent political coalition is the only way in which the economic interests of those in the bottom half of the income distribution will be effectively addressed.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMore than any president in living memory, Donald Trump has conducted a dogged, remorseless assault on the press. He portrays the news media not only as a dedicated adversary of his administration but of the entire body politic. These attacks have forced the media where it does not want to be, at the center of the political debate.Trump’s purpose is clear. He seeks to weaken an institution that serves to constrain the abusive exercise of executive authority. He has initiated a gladiatorial contest pitting the principle of freedom of the press against a principle of his own invention: freedom from the press.Trump has his media favorites, Fox News and other organizations that serve as approved public relations outlets, versus the “fake news,” meaning virtually everything else.Politicians have frequently questioned the neutrality and objectivity of specific journalists, their stories and their publications, but Trump has raised the stakes to a new level. He has described news organizations as “the enemy of the American people.” He has routinely called reporters “scum,” “slime,” “dishonest” and “disgusting.”In November, Trump proposed a contest to determine which network — Fox excluded — “is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!”The news media “have been incorporated into the political style of the governing party as fixed hate objects,” Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at N.Y.U., wrote in an email to me.Rosen observed that the history of right-wing attacks on the mediaextends back through Agnew’s speeches for Nixon to Goldwater’s campaign in 1964 and winds forward through William Rusher, talk radio, and of course Fox News, which founded a business model on liberal bias.There is an underlying strategy to Trump’s critique of the media. Rosen continued:Trump is not just attacking the press but the conditions that make it possible for news reports to serve as any kind of check on power. Trump is the apotheosis of this history and its accelerant. He has advanced the proposition dramatically. From undue influence (Agnew’s claim) to something closer to treason (enemy of the people.) Instead of criticizing ‘the media’ for unfair treatment, he whips up hatred for it. Some of his most demagogic performances have been exactly that. Nixon seethed about the press in private. Trump seethes in public, a very different act.Trump has some built-in advantages in his war on the media. Confidence in the media was in decline long before Trump entered politics — a slide that reflected the rise in political polarization. Gallup reported in September 2017 that 37 percent of the public had a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence in the mass media, down from 53 percent in 1997. And Trump’s critique of the media reaches a highly receptive audience.An April 2017 Gallup survey found that by a margin of more than 2 to 1, the public said that the press favored one party over the other. Of those who said the media is partisan, 64 percent said that the media favors Democrats, and 22 percent said Republicans.The media, on the other hand, enters the fray with significant disadvantages.In a 2017 paper, “Enemy Construction and the Press,” RonNell Andersen Jones and Lisa Grow Sun, law professors at the University of Utah and Brigham Young University, argue that Trump’s goal is fundamentally malign:The Trump administration, with a rhetoric that began during the campaign and burgeoned in the earliest days of Donald Trump’s presidency, has engaged in enemy construction of the press, and the risks that accompany that categorization are grave.Insofar as Trump succeeds in “undercutting the watchdog, educator, and proxy functions of the press,” they write, itleaves the administration more capable of delegitimizing other institutions and constructing other enemies — including the judiciary, the intelligence community, immigrants, and members of certain races or religions.Jones and Sun contend that in many respects, Trump is reminiscent of Richard M. Nixon:Nixon, like Trump, accused the media of being out to get him and predicted that the press would mischaracterize his public support or the reception he received. He believed the liberal media to be biased against him personally, maintaining that he had “entered the presidency with less support from the major publications and TV networks than any president in history” and that “their whole objective in life is to bring us down.”Unlike Trump, however, Nixon (like the country’s founders)routinely reaffirmed to both the press and the public that he conceived of the press as central to democracy. Indeed, in his first speech to the public regarding the Watergate scandal, Nixon acknowledged that “the system that brought the facts to light and that will bring those guilty to justice” was a system that included “a vigorous free press.”Trump stands out, according to Jones and Sun, in that his administrationhas passed a threshold not approached by previous administrations in their tensions with the media. Trump is signaling — through his terminology, through his delegitimizing actions, and through his anticipatory undercutting — that the press is literally the enemy, to be distrusted, ignored, and excluded.In response to my email, Jones replied that “war has been declared, whether they (the media) like it or not.” She noted that the instincts of the pressmotivate it to want to call out the changing norms that it sees around it, and to defend the role of important democratic institutions when they are attacked. But when the press is itself one of those institutions, it finds itself a part of the story in ways that it is unaccustomed to being, and it has to weigh the potential loss of credibility that might come with an aggressive self-defense.I asked Jonathan Ladd, a professor of public policy and government at Georgetown, what strategies he thought the media should adopt to counter negative portrayals by conservatives.“The best way for the press to react to Trump’s undemocratic behavior is to continue trying to do their jobs the best they can,” Ladd wrote. “The press is not perfect, but Trump’s bad behavior doesn’t change what they need to do.”Ladd specifically warned against “reacting to Trump by becoming more crusadingly anti-Trump.”Trump has successfully “put the mainstream media in a difficult position,” according to Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago:If the media directly address the accusations of fake news, they ironically run the risk of dignifying the accusations. But if they ignore the accusations, they miss the opportunity to prove their professionalism to those who have grown skeptical.In the long term, Stone suggested, we could begin to remedy this problem if we improved civic education and encouraged a stronger defense of the media by politicians, especially Republicans — a prospect about which he is not optimistic.Of the media itself, however, Stone wrote:I don’t know that there’s really much they can do to defend themselves. Those who trust them will continue to trust them. Those who distrust them are unlikely to be brought around by anything they themselves are likely to say.Trump’s disdain for the First Amendment is an integral part of a much longer series of developments in which both parties have demonstrated a willingness to defy democratic norms, although the Republican Party has been in the forefront.In “Asymmetric Constitutional Hardball,” Joseph Fishkin and David E. Pozen, law professors at the University of Texas and Columbia, write:For a quarter of a century, Republican officials have been more willing than Democratic officials to play constitutional hardball — not only or primarily on judicial nominations but across a range of spheres. Democrats have also availed themselves of hardball throughout this period, but not with the same frequency or intensity.Fishkin and Pozen cite the work of Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, to define constitutional hardball as “political claims and practices”that are without much question within the bounds of existing constitutional doctrine and practice but that are nonetheless in some tension with existing pre-constitutional understandings. Constitutional hardball tactics are viewed by the other side as provocative and unfair because they flout the ‘goes without saying’ assumptions that underpin working systems of constitutional government. Such tactics do not generally flout binding legal norms. But that only heightens the sense of foul play insofar as it insulates acts of hardball from judicial review.Republicans on the far right, in particular, Fishkin and Pozen write, have been willing to engage in constitutional hardball because they are drawn to “narratives of debasement and restoration,” which suggestthat something has gone fundamentally awry in the republic, on the order of an existential crisis, and that unpatriotic liberals have allowed or caused it to happen.The severity of the liberal threat, in the eyes of these conservatives, justifies extreme steps to restore what they see as a besieged moral order.In an email, Fishkin wrote:As with so many things about President Trump, it strikes me that he didn’t start the fire. He got into office because it was already burning and now he’s pouring on gasoline.In Fishkin’s view, Trump will do all he can to make the conflict between his party and the press “sharper and more intense, in the same way that he depends on and aims to intensify partisan polarization.”Pozen warned in an email:Accusations that the press has a political agenda can, perversely, help create an agenda which is then said to corroborate the accusations.Pozen described Trump’s denunciation of the press as “the culmination of several decades of comparable attacks by media pundits, such as Rush Limbaugh” and he argues that Trump’s callsto lock up one’s general election opponent, encouraging online hate mobs, lying constantly, attacking the press constantly, contradicting oneself constantly, undermining the very idea of truth are individually and in common potentially profound threats to the integrity and quality of our system of free expression.The question is whether the news media can mount an effective check on the exercise of power when the media itself has become an object of hatred for a large segment of the electorate.Rosen of N.Y.U. notes the cross pressures on the news media:I think our top journalists are correct that if they become the political opposition to Trump, and see themselves that way, they lose. But they have to go to war against a political style in which power gets to write its own story.Rosen draws attention to a September 2017 article in The Atlantic, “Trump’s War Against the Media Isn’t a War: You need two sides for that,” which quotes Marty Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post: “We’re not at war; we’re at work.” Baron is right, but for those without any understanding of — or respect for — freedom of the press, first principles can be brushed aside without a second thought.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

Sign up here.President Trump on Monday blocked Broadcom’s bid for the chip maker Qualcomm, citing national security concerns.In a presidential order, Mr. Trump said “there is credible evidence” that led him to believe Singapore-based Broadcom’s control of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.”AdvertisementThe extraordinary action by the president underscored the more forceful and protectionist action his administration has taken in recent weeks to protect American companies and ward off foreign investment in the United States. It followed an intervention this month by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, to stall the deal because of national security concerns.AdvertisementFrom President Trump’s order:(a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (Broadcom), along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation, and Broadcom Cayman L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership, and their partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates (together, the Purchaser), through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and(b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter.Further down(e) The Purchaser and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed.Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won’t bail out if they blow up.This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs.In apparently priming David M. Solomon for the job, Goldman seems to be signaling that, even if trading revenue revives after some difficult quarters, it intends to press on with its efforts to bolster its nontrading businesses, like lending to corporations and consumers. Mr. Solomon, after a successful run as the head of Goldman’s powerful deal-making business, embodies in many ways the bank’s hopes to be far more than a high-octane trading shop.Of course, if the Trump administration guts Wall Street regulations, particularly the Volcker Rule, Goldman may be tempted to pile back into trading. But the bank’s recent track record in trading suggests that would not be a good idea.Not only does Goldman’s business that trades bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities bounce around too much for shareholders’ tastes, it is opaque. Bank executives are often loath to talk in detail when it underperforms.Goldman also made strategic mistakes in this business in recent years. It focused too heavily on hedge fund clients, something it is trying to fix by reaching out to different types of customers. Its commodities business, which it clung to in the face of political pressure, has been a drawn out disappointment.And Wall Street traders ought not to get too excited about the prospects of deregulation. As some rules get loosened, others may get toughened up, like those that would liquidate a troubled Wall Street firm rather than bail it out. While the government may not be winding down any large banks anytime soon, the diminished likelihood of bailouts can force up the cost of borrowing for firms like Goldman. This, in turn, may steer them away from riskier businesses like trading.Investors still seem to doubt Goldman’s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley.AdvertisementGoldman’s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders’ money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman’s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable.— Peter EavisDavid M.

Schwartz were seen as the favorites to eventually replace Mr. Blankfein when they were named co-chief operating officers and presidents in December 2016.But, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank’s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday.“Harvey has been a mentor to many, and his influence has made an indelible impact on generations of professionals at Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Blankfein said in a news release. “I want to thank Harvey for all he’s done for the firm.”Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division.— Chad BrayCritic’s cornerAnthony Currie of Breakingviews writes: “If Solomon does take the reins, it would end some 12 years of traders holding top positions at the Wall Street firm – and serve as another sign of Goldman’s troubles in that business.”Case in point:• Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman’s revenue in 2012.• It made just over a third of the firm’s revenue last year.Advertisement“Meanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting – Solomon’s world – increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.”Goldman’s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables.So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here’s a look:Global Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billionJPMorgan: $198.82 billionBank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billionLazard: $134.39 billionGoldman Sachs: $131.56 billionUnited StatesMorgan Stanley: $132.36 billionLazard: $119.69 billionJPMorgan: $114.37 billionCenterview: $112.75 billionGoldman Sachs: $102.54 billionTwo points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago.Larry Kudlow emerged Monday as the latest favorite in a changing rotation of potential replacements for Gary D. Cohn as the head the National Economic Council.The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days.ContextFrom the NYT’s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley: Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell’s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point.But after The New York Times reported that Mr. Liddell was under consideration, Mr. Trump received pushback from people both inside and outside the White House, according to the people close to the president. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board wrote a piece critical of Mr. Liddell’s views on free trade.On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said.In a revised prospectus filed this morning, the online storage company said that it planned to sell 36 million shares at $16 to $18 a share. At the midpoint of that range, Dropbox would be valued at about $7.5 billion, compared to the $10 billion of its most recent private fund-raising.AdvertisementThe big thought: The Dropbox offering — along with that of Spotify — could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley “unicorns,” or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion.The man who made Dropbox: Meet Drew Houston, who created a multibillion-dollar business because he forgot to bring a USB flash drive one day while a student at M.I.T. His holdings could be worth nearly $1.7 billionThe market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox’s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated.Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18.The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future.That’s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014.At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January.Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox’s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.)AdvertisementNeither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox’s cash flows were more than five times those of Box’s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday’s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box’s cash flow multiple.— Peter EavisSpeculation has long swirled that Apple should buy Netflix.

The subtitle is no overstatement: In the early 1920s, first in Paris and then back home in São Paulo, Brazil, this painter really did lay the groundwork for the coming of modernism in Latin America’s most populous nation. Tired of the European pretenders in Brazil’s art academies, Tarsila (who was always called by her first name) began to intermingle Western, African and indigenous motifs into flowing, biomorphic paintings, and to theorize a new national culture fueled by the principle of antropofagia, or “cannibalism.” Along with spare, assured drawings of Rio and the Brazilian countryside, this belated but very welcome show assembles Tarsila’s three most important paintings, including the classic “Abaporu” (1928): a semi-human nude with a spindly nose and a comically swollen foot. (Jason Farago)212-708-9400, moma.org‘BIRDS OF A FEATHER: JOSEPH CORNELL’S HOMAGE TO JUAN GRIS’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through April 15). This small, hyper-specialized, stunning exhibition brings together a grand total of only 13 works — a dozen shadow boxes by Joseph Cornell, the Queens-based assemblage artist, and the Cubist masterwork that he cited as their direct inspiration, Gris’s “Man at the Café” (1914). It might seem like a surprising obsession for Cornell, who was not a painter nor a Frenchman. He and Gris never met. But Cornell was deeply moved by Gris, the overlooked, tag-along third wheel in the Cubist movement that also included Picasso and Braque, and the show succeeds in tracking the fluttery ways of artistic inspiration. (Deborah Solomon)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘DIAMOND MOUNTAINS: TRAVEL AND NOSTALGIA IN KOREAN ART’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 20). Mount Kumgang, or the “Diamond Mountain,” lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang’s Olympic Stadium, but it’s a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. Featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, this melancholy beauty of a show assembles three centuries’ worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘THE FACE OF DYNASTY: ROYAL CRESTS FROM WESTERN CAMEROON’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 3). In the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster in its own right. These massive wooden crests — in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows — served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met’s recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a “sculpture” divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and story boards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago)718-784-0077, movingimage.us‘PETER HUJAR: SPEED OF LIFE’ at the Morgan Library and Museum (through May 20). It’s hard to say which is more surprising: that Peter Hujar’s photographs of underground life in New York in the 1970s and ’80s have found their way to the Morgan Library and Museum, or that the classically minded institution has become unbuttoned enough to exhibit them in this heartbreaker of a show. Hujar (1934-87) lived most of his professional life in the East Village and, through studio portraits and cityscapes, captured a downtown that has since been all but erased by time, gentrification and AIDS. Although he was little known by the mainstream art world in his lifetime, this show, startlingly tender, reveals him to be one of the major American photographers of the late 20th century. (Holland Cotter) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org‘THE INCOMPLETE ARAKI’ at the Museum of Sex (through Aug. 31). It remains a bit of a tourist trap, but the for-profit Museum of Sex is making its most serious bid yet for artistic credibility with a two-floor exhibition of Japan’s most prominent and controversial photographer. Nobuyoshi Araki has spent decades shooting Tokyo streetscapes, blossoming flowers and, notably, women trussed up in the baroque rope bondage technique known as kinbaku-bi, or “the beauty of tight binding.” Given the venue, it’s natural that this show concentrates on the erotic side of his art, but less lustful visitors can discover an ambitious cross section of Mr. Araki’s omnivorous photography, including his lastingly moving “Sentimental Journey,” picturing his beloved wife, Yoko, from honeymoon to funeral. (Farago)212-689-6337, museumofsex.com‘ZOE LEONARD: SURVEY’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through June 10). Some shows cast a spell. Zoe Leonard’s reverberant retrospective does. Physically ultra-austere, all white walls with a fiercely edited selection of objects — photographs of clouds taken from airplane windows; a mural collaged from vintage postcards; a scattering of empty fruit skins, each stitched closed with needle and thread — it’s an extended essay about travel, time passing, political passion and the ineffable daily beauty of the world. (Cotter)212-570-3600, whitney.org‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through Nov. 4). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Roberta Smith)212-708-9400, moma.org‘MILLENNIUM: LOWER MANHATTAN IN THE 1990S’ at the Skyscraper Museum (through April). This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico’s at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished. (Farago)skyscraper.org‘OUTLIERS AND AMERICAN VANGUARD ART’ at the National Gallery of Art, Washington (through May 13). Tracing the interaction of taught and untaught artists over the past century, this exhibition tackles an impossibly immense subject and starts stronger than it finishes. But it presents quantities of stunning art in all mediums, revealing the vastness of American creativity and the many attempts by museums to do it justice. It proves more forcefully than ever that the distinction between the works of the self-taught and that of the professionals has outlived its relevance. (Smith)202-737-4215, nga.gov‘REBEL SPIRITS: ROBERT F. KENNEDY AND MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 20). Delve into the ties that bound these progressive standard-bearers through photographs that document their rise to the national stage in the 1950s and ’60s and the struggle for the societal changes they championed, and ephemera such as magazines, campaign buttons, protest placards and an R.F.K.-M.L.K. spinning pendant. You can even listen on a transistor radio to the song Dick Holler wrote after their assassinations in 1968, “Abraham, Martin and John.” (Dowling)212-873-3400, nyhistory.org‘ALBERTO SAVINIO’ at the Center for Italian Modern Art (through June 23). The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico. This show of more than 20 canvases from the late 1920s to the mid-’30s may not change that, but the mix of landscapes with bright patterns and several eerie portraits based on family photographs are surprisingly of the moment. (Smith)646-370-3596, italianmodernart.org‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago)212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org‘STEPHEN SHORE’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 28). Not staged, not lit, not cropped, not retouched, the color photographs of this American master are feats of dispassionate representation. This must-see retrospective — curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA’s photo chief — opens with Mr. Shore’s teenage snaps at Andy Warhol’s Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of “American Surfaces” and the steely precision of “Uncommon Places” — landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA’s smudged iPads. New technologies are great, but not at the expense of concentration. (Farago)212-708-9400, moma.org‘2018 TRIENNIAL: SONGS FOR SABOTAGE’ at the New Museum (through May 27). This Bowery museum’s fourth triennial exhibition, “Songs for Sabotage,” is the smallest, tightest edition of the show so far. Immaculately installed, it’s also the best looking. There’s a lot of good work, which is global in scope and not by a list of prevetted up-and-comers. (Zhenya Machneva, Dalton Paula and Daniela Ortiz are artists to look for.) Less admirably, it’s a safe and unchallenging show. Despite a politically demanding time, it acts as if ambiguity and discretion were automatically virtues. In an era when the market rules, it puts its money on the kind of art — easily tradable, displayable, palette-tickling objects — that art fairs suck up. (Cotter)212-219-1222, newmuseum.org‘THE VIETNAM WAR: 1945-1975’ at the New-York Historical Society (through April 22). In contrast to the PBS series “The Vietnam War,” this exhibition delivers historical data, a lot of it, quick and dirty, through labels, film and audio clips and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art. Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, there’s graffiti-style drawings on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in album covers and protest posters. Words and images work together in murals labeled “Home Front” and “War Front” that put you in the middle of the war’s primary issues and events. (Cotter)212-873-3400, nyhistory.org‘ZURBARÁN’S JACOB AND HIS TWELVE SONS: PAINTINGS FROM AUCKLAND CASTLE’ at the Frick Collection (through April 22). More devout than Velázquez, more shadowy than Murillo, Francisco de Zurbarán was little known outside Spain until the mid-19th century, when Manet and his friends found the seeds of modernism in his frisky, open brushwork and streamlined form. The Frick is now showing a baker’s dozen of the Spaniard’s biblical portraits, of aged, hunched Jacob and the sons who would become the founders of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, with most of the paintings on loan from a castle that until recently belonged to the Church of England. The gents pose in a startling variety of crisp, supple fabrics, whose glamour or grittiness echoes Jacob’s foretelling of their destinies in Genesis. Two are especially compelling: Judah, child No. 4, decked out in a fur-trimmed coat and vamping alongside a kindly lion, and Joseph, who forgoes the Technicolor dreamcoat for a blue sash and a belt stitched with gold. (Farago)212-288-0700, frick.org‘THE BEAUTIFUL BRAIN: THE DRAWINGS OF SANTIAGO RAMÓN Y CAJAL’ at Grey Art Gallery (through March 31). The first United States museum exhibition devoted to the scientific illustrations of this Spanish giant of neuroscience is among the year’s best so far. Its 80 freehand renderings of different brain cells, as viewed through a microscope, helped prove that they are unconnected, communicating across tiny gaps called synaptic clefts, which earned Cajal a Nobel Prize in 1906. His exquisite images, still used in textbooks, ignite synaptic charges throughout 20th-century art, from Surrealism onward. (Smith)212-998-6780, greyartgallery.nyu.edu‘EXPERIMENTS IN ELECTROSTATICS: PHOTOCOPY ART FROM THE WHITNEY’S COLLECTION, 1966-1986’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through March 25). The photocopier never gained traction as a popular artistic tool, but this exhibition is an intriguing curiosity, showcasing the work of three artists and a collective who worked seriously with machines that were invented to reproduce office documents. Edward Meneeley, a photographer, embraced the photocopier, making small wallpaperlike abstractions, while Lesley Schiff created deadpan images of everyday objects and Barbara T. Smith generated hazy abstractions with cooking flour (and feminist overtones). The International Society of Copier Artists, which had 500 members at one point, produced work that ranged from still lifes to graphic montages reminiscent of contemporaneous punk rock album covers and zines. (Martha Schwendener)212-570-3600, whitney.org‘HOTBED’ at the New-York Historical Society (through March 25). Celebrating the centennial of the passage of women’s voting rights in New York State, this exhibition at the museum’s Joyce B. Cowin Women’s History Gallery assembles more than 100 images and artifacts, including advocative posters; progressive magazines of the time, such as The Woman Voter; and cookbooks and pepper shakers bearing suffragist propaganda. These items tell the story of the women’s rights movement in the early 20th century — its evolution, its impact and its epicenter in Greenwich Village. (Dowling)212-873-3400, nyhistory.org‘JOYCE J. SCOTT: HARRIET TUBMAN AND OTHER TRUTHS’ at Grounds for Sculpture (through April 1). The work of this recent MacArthur fellowship winner, Nancy Princenthal wrote in The Times, “proves just how sharp glass can get.” Ms. Scott uses hand-threaded beads and blown glass to create art that is “a revelation, inviting covetous attention to what often turn out, on close inspection, to be brutal subjects: vicious racism, violent misogyny,” Ms. Princenthal added. Among the exhibition’s highlights are three sculptures of Harriet Tubman, including one armed with a flower-embossed rifle and one made of rammed earth that is meant to erode over time at this Hamilton, N.J., sculpture garden.

The subtitle is no overstatement: In the early 1920s, first in Paris and then back home in São Paulo, Brazil, this painter really did lay the groundwork for the coming of modernism in Latin America’s most populous nation. Tired of the European pretenders in Brazil’s art academies, Tarsila (who was always called by her first name) began to intermingle Western, African and indigenous motifs into flowing, biomorphic paintings, and to theorize a new national culture fueled by the principle of antropofagia, or “cannibalism.” Along with spare, assured drawings of Rio and the Brazilian countryside, this belated but very welcome show assembles Tarsila’s three most important paintings, including the classic “Abaporu” (1928): a semi-human nude with a spindly nose and a comically swollen foot.

An exhibition in the form of a chokehold, the third of the Neue Galerie’s recent shows on art and German politics pushes into the years of dictatorship, with paintings, drawings and photographs by artists deemed “degenerate” by the Nazis — as well as by those who joined the party or who thought they could shut out the catastrophe. (You will know the dissidents, like Max Beckmann and Oskar Kokoschka; the fascists and sellouts are less known.) Gazing at macabre still lifes of dolls and dead flowers, or dreamy landscapes in imitation of an earlier German Romanticism, you may ask to what degree artists are responsible for the times in which they work. But then you see “Self-Portrait in the Camp,” by the Jewish German painter Felix Nussbaum — made between his escape from a French internment camp and his deportation to Auschwitz — and you know that there can be no pardon. (Farago)212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org‘HUMA BHABHA: WE COME IN PEACE’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 28). This spare and unsettling sculptural installation for the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden Commission includes two figures: one that is somewhat humanoid but with a ferocious mask-face and that visually dwarfs the jagged Manhattan skyline behind it, and another bowing in supplication or prayer, with long cartoonish human hands and a scraggly tail emerging from its shiny, black drapery. The title is a variant on the line an alien uttered to an anxious crowd in the 1951 science-fiction movie “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” but it ripples with other associations: colonization, invasion, imperialism or missionaries and other foreigners whose intentions were not always innocent. The installation also feels like an extension of the complex, cross-cultural conversation going on downstairs, inside a museum packed with 5,000 years of art history. (Martha Schwendener)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘DIAMOND MOUNTAINS: TRAVEL AND NOSTALGIA IN KOREAN ART’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 20). Mount Kumgang, or the “Diamond Mountain,” lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang’s Olympic Stadium, but it’s a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. Featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, this melancholy beauty of a show assembles three centuries’ worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘THE FACE OF DYNASTY: ROYAL CRESTS FROM WESTERN CAMEROON’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 3). In the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster in its own right. These massive wooden crests — in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows — served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met’s recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a “sculpture” divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and story boards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago)718-784-0077, movingimage.us‘PETER HUJAR: SPEED OF LIFE’ at the Morgan Library and Museum (through May 20). It’s hard to say which is more surprising: that Peter Hujar’s photographs of underground life in New York in the 1970s and ’80s have found their way to the Morgan Library and Museum, or that the classically minded institution has become unbuttoned enough to exhibit them in this heartbreaker of a show. Hujar (1934-87) lived most of his professional life in the East Village and, through studio portraits and cityscapes, captured a downtown that has since been all but erased by time, gentrification and AIDS. Although he was little known by the mainstream art world in his lifetime, this show, startlingly tender, reveals him to be one of the major American photographers of the late 20th century. (Holland Cotter) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org‘THE INCOMPLETE ARAKI’ at the Museum of Sex (through Aug. 31). It remains a bit of a tourist trap, but the for-profit Museum of Sex is making its most serious bid yet for artistic credibility with a two-floor exhibition of Japan’s most prominent and controversial photographer. Nobuyoshi Araki has spent decades shooting Tokyo streetscapes, blossoming flowers and, notably, women trussed up in the baroque rope bondage technique known as kinbaku-bi, or “the beauty of tight binding.” Given the venue, it’s natural that this show concentrates on the erotic side of his art, but less lustful visitors can discover an ambitious cross section of Mr. Araki’s omnivorous photography, including his lastingly moving “Sentimental Journey,” picturing his beloved wife, Yoko, from honeymoon to funeral. (Farago)212-689-6337, museumofsex.com‘ZOE LEONARD: SURVEY’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through June 10). Some shows cast a spell. Zoe Leonard’s reverberant retrospective does. Physically ultra-austere, all white walls with a fiercely edited selection of objects — photographs of clouds taken from airplane windows; a mural collaged from vintage postcards; a scattering of empty fruit skins, each stitched closed with needle and thread — it’s an extended essay about travel, time passing, political passion and the ineffable daily beauty of the world. (Cotter)212-570-3600, whitney.org‘LIKE LIFE: SCULPTURE, COLOR AND THE BODY (1300 TO NOW)’ at the Met Breuer (through July 22). Taking a second run at the splashy theme-show extravaganza, the Met Breuer has greater success. This one is certainly more coherent since it centers entirely on the body and its role in art, science, religion and entertainment. It gathers together some 120 sculptures, dolls, artist’s dummies, effigies, crucifixes and automatons. Many are rarely lent and may not return any time soon. (Roberta Smith)212-731-1675, metmuseum.org‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through Nov. 4). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith)212-708-9400, moma.org‘SALLY MANN: A THOUSAND CROSSINGS’ at the National Gallery of Art, Washington (through May 28). All of this photographer’s strengths are on view in this deftly chosen and admirably displayed exhibition that covers most of her 40-plus-year career. The 108 images here (47 of which have never been exhibited before) provide a provocative tour through Ms. Mann’s accomplishments and serve as a record of exploration — into the past, into this country’s and photography’s history, stamped with a powerful vision. (Vicki Goldberg)202-737-4215, nga.gov‘THE METROPOLIS IN LATIN AMERICA, 1830-1930’ at Americas Society (through June 30). Fans of Latin American architecture are overly besotted with the modernist era: Luis Barragán’s color-saturated houses in Mexico City, Oscar Niemeyer’s cutting-edge presidential palace in Brasília. But this eye-opening show turns the clock back 100 years and shows how six cities — Buenos Aires; Havana; Lima, Peru; Mexico City; Rio de Janeiro; and Santiago, Chile — used architecture and urban design to express new national ambitions. Vintage photographs disclose how in Mexico’s sprawling capital its new republican government erected statues of Cuauhtémoc, the last Aztec emperor, while Argentina plowed out lordly avenues in imitation of Haussmann-era Paris. All these cities had keen architectural ambitions, though if you have to pick the most sophisticated, it’s Rio in a landslide. Stare at Marc Ferrez’s jaw-dropping 1895 panoramic photograph of the erstwhile Brazilian capital, with Sugarloaf Mountain looming over Botafogo and Flamengo, and book the next flight. (Farago)212-249-8950, as-coa.org‘MILLENNIUM: LOWER MANHATTAN IN THE 1990S’ at the Skyscraper Museum (through June 24). This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico’s at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished. (Farago)skyscraper.org‘REBEL SPIRITS: ROBERT F. KENNEDY AND MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 20). Featuring stark black-and-white photographs of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as faded ephemera that memorialized them, this exhibition reveals the various ways in which the lives of these two influential figures were juxtaposed. It also traces the circuitous routes that belatedly pointed Kennedy toward the more incendiary goals King set first regarding civil rights, poverty and the Vietnam War. (Sam Roberts) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org‘ALBERTO SAVINIO’ at the Center for Italian Modern Art (through June 23). The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico. This show of more than 20 canvases from the late 1920s to the mid-30s may not change that, but the mix of landscapes with bright patterns and several eerie portraits based on family photographs are surprisingly of the moment. (Smith)646-370-3596, italianmodernart.org‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago)212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org‘THE SENSES: DESIGN BEYOND VISION’ at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum (through Oct. 28). There’s a serious, timely big idea at this exhibition: As social media, smartphones and virtual reality make us ever more “ocularcentric,” we have taken leave of our nonvisual senses — and need to get back in touch, literally. Thus “The Senses” features multisensory adventures such as a portable-speaker-size contraption that emits odors, with titles like “Surfside” and “Einstein,” in timed combinations; hand-painted scratch-and-sniff wallpaper (think Warhol’s patterned cows but with cherries — cherry-scented, naturally); and a device that projects ultrasonic sound waves to simulate the touch and feel of virtual objects. The show also presents commissions, videos, products and prototypes from more than 65 designers and teams, some of which address sensory disabilities like blindness and deafness, including Vibeat, which can be worn as a bracelet, brooch or necklace and translates music into vibrations. And if you bring the kids, they will likely bliss out stroking a wavy, fur-lined installation that makes music as you rub it. (Michael Kimmelman)212-849-8400, cooperhewitt.org‘STEPHEN SHORE’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 28). Not staged, not lit, not cropped, not retouched, the color photographs of this American master are feats of dispassionate representation. This must-see retrospective — curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA’s photo chief — opens with Mr. Shore’s teenage snaps at Andy Warhol’s Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of “American Surfaces” and the steely precision of “Uncommon Places” — landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA’s smudged iPads. New technologies are great, but not at the expense of concentration. (Farago)212-708-9400, moma.org‘2018 TRIENNIAL: SONGS FOR SABOTAGE’ at the New Museum (through May 27). This Bowery museum’s fourth triennial exhibition, “Songs for Sabotage,” is the smallest, tightest edition of the show so far. Immaculately installed, it’s also the best looking. There’s a lot of good work, which is global in scope and not by a list of prevetted up-and-comers. (Zhenya Machneva, Dalton Paula and Daniela Ortiz are artists to look for.) Less admirably, it’s a safe and unchallenging show. Despite a politically demanding time, it acts as if ambiguity and discretion were automatically virtues. In an era when the market rules, it puts its money on the kind of art — easily tradable, displayable, palette-tickling objects — that art fairs suck up. (Cotter)212-219-1222, newmuseum.org‘GRANT WOOD: AMERICAN GOTHIC AND OTHER FABLES’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through June 10). This well-done survey begins with the American Regionalist’s little-known efforts as an Arts and Crafts designer and touches just about every base. It includes his mural studies, book illustrations and most of his best-known paintings — including “American Gothic” and “The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.” Best of all are Wood’s smooth undulant landscapes with their plowmen and spongy trees and infectious serenity. (Smith) 212-570-3600, whitney.org‘THOMAS COLE’S JOURNEY: ATLANTIC CROSSING’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 13). The Met’s exhibition of the nation’s first major landscape artist and progenitor of what would be called the Hudson River School is gorgeous, politically right for right now and a lesson in the mutability of art history. Politically, Cole’s art is conservative, but it’s also work that challenges and complicates that term. And this show is precisely about complication. Just as Cole is most realistically and revealingly seen and judged against the background of his time, so is the exhibition, coming as it does in this confounding MAGA moment. (Cotter)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘OUTLIERS AND AMERICAN VANGUARD ART’ at the National Gallery of Art, Washington (through May 13). Tracing the interaction of taught and untaught artists over the past century, this exhibition tackles an impossibly immense subject and starts stronger than it finishes. But it presents quantities of stunning art in all mediums, revealing the vastness of American creativity and the many attempts by museums to do it justice. It proves more forcefully than ever that the distinction between the works of the self-taught and that of the professionals has outlived its usefulness. (Smith)202-737-4215, nga.gov‘DANH VO: TAKE MY BREATH AWAY’ at the Guggenheim Museum (through May 9). This is the first museum survey of the Vietnam-born Danish artist, who draws his art from his life and the history he has lived through, recycling family mementos, found letters and artifacts, as well as random materials, into a very spare, poetic and astute study of power, colonialism, and the lives of refugees and of objects. The Guggenheim’s rotunda looks nearly empty at times, and there are lots of labels to read, but it is ultimately worth it. (Smith) 212-423-3500, guggenheim.orgAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

business,"AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyBy Ron LieberNEW ORLEANS — In the world of workplace retirement plans, there is a persistent problem with 403(b)’s, which are like 401(k)’s but for nonprofit employees.The people who do some of the most good in the world (and often get paid the least for it) end up in high-cost plans with second-rate investment choices. When these employees finally wise up, it can take years to find a better deal and get their human resources departments, or bosses, to find an outside financial adviser who can help them switch plans.There are few people who understand this reality better than Ryan Frailich. Over about a decade, he’s gone from working as a teacher in three states to running the human resources department for a charter school. Then, fed up and worried about the fate of his fellow educators, he became a financial adviser here to help them set a better course.Along the way, he had set aside his own money in a succession of 403(b) plans that were mediocre or worse, sometimes at the behest of sales representatives bearing candy and dispensing hugs who put other young adults into annuities paying low fixed rates. Then, he ran into brick walls while spending hour upon hour trying to extract people from those accounts.None of it needed to happen. When the teachers trying to turn around the city’s troubled schools end up feeling like they’ve been punished financially for their efforts, something is wrong. It raises the question of whether the complex 403(b) plans were erected for the benefit of the very people who built the systems.Mr. Frailich, 32, is the son of a Minnesota stockbroker, but he wasn’t thinking about the details of his retirement plan when he took his first job as a Teach for America educator in Mississippi. As he moved from there to Brooklyn and then to New Orleans, he was just glad to be saving something for later and getting some matching contributions. “I didn’t know I had an annuity,” he said. “I was just glad that I was putting away 10 percent of my salary.”At age 26, as the human resources director for a charter school in New Orleans, he woke up to the fact that he and his colleagues had money in some problematic annuities — financial products that may promise a particular return but often limit your ability to sell them and come with very high fees. Local sales representatives who were independent agents had helped set up the school’s plan. Mr. Frailich found employees in their 20s with fixed-rate annuities earning just 3 percent, hardly enough to secure a comfortable retirement.Because of prohibitively high costs, his school did not participate in the state’s teacher pension plan, so the 403(b) plan was all that was offered to him and his colleagues.Moreover, many states, including Louisiana, have pension funds that are badly underfunded, and keep pushing off what seem like inevitable benefit cuts or income tax hikes to cover the shortfall. Some younger teachers, especially those who are not sure they will make a 40-year career in education, approach them with wariness.Mr. Frailich realized his colleagues needed the ability to invest directly in mutual funds in their retirement plan, the way most people with for-profit employers can. That would give them a chance at higher returns. To do that, however, those colleagues needed entirely new accounts — on top of the annuities in their original accounts, which came with penalties if you sold them before several years had gone by.“In the process of making things better, I also had to make them more complex,” Mr. Frailich said. After he left the school, another administrator made further adjustments, leaving some veteran teachers there with five or six separate 403(b) accounts.Now, years later, some of his former colleagues (some of whom have become clients) are having a hard time getting out of the old 403(b)’s and into one consolidated account that would be simpler and cheaper. Some of the problem appears to be sloppiness on the part of Voya Financial, the company that controls the old accounts.One teacher, Katie Harvey, recently discovered that Voya had her first name wrong, her birthday wrong and her email wrong. Changing all of that required printing out a form and sending Voya a copy of her identification by mail.Another teacher, Sara Wilson, had been trying for four months to extract her accounts from Voya, but still hadn’t managed to finish when I spoke to her this week, even with the help of other local financial advisers. “It’s been very entertaining to listen in on the calls,” she said. “The girl is saying words to me that I don’t understand. And my adviser keeps saying ‘Do you expect my client to understand this?’”Kristin Foght, who also teaches in the area, tried to move her accounts away from Voya without any expert help. She began in August. There were name-change forms, since she got married along the way. Then spousal consent forms. Then demands for notarization. Then requests for a letter of acceptance from the company that would be receiving the funds. Then a requirement to fax the forms. “They kept telling me that they were not getting the fax,” she said. “And I kept saying ‘Nobody faxes anymore besides you guys!’”At one point, the letters of acceptance expired. So she found herself driving 20 minutes with her 2-year-old in the car to an after-hours notary. But what really pushed her over the edge, she said, was when a Voya supervisor said she was transferring forms to a third-party administrator and then failed to do so. A month later, Ms. Foght said, that same person told her that the wrong page had been notarized, and Ms. Foght would have to begin again.So why were these teachers in low-rate annuities in the first place, instead of simple and cheap index funds? Voya would not answer that question, but one of the original independent sales representatives, Delinda Duncan, who no longer sells Voya’s annuities, did. “Teachers are very conservative in Louisiana,” she said. “It’s a little different than in other parts of the country.”She added that in many instances there were variable annuities available that did allow people to participate in the growth of the stock market.As for the service issues these teachers encountered, Voya examined Ms. Wilson’s and Ms. Foght’s situations and expressed contrition. “We acknowledge that, in both cases, we did not meet the high service standards that we deliver on a consistent and reliable basis to our five million retirement plan customers,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Our culture is centered on continuous improvement, and we will be reviewing the opportunities here to help avoid future processing delays. The transactions for both customers are now complete and rollover checks have been issued.”Mr. Frailich spent eight hours extracting his own Voya accounts, an experience he described as “brutal.” And while he used to harbor ill will for Ms. Duncan and her mother, who sold products with her, he no longer does. “People get caught up in a sales culture selling things that maybe they don’t understand,” he said. “I believe they thought they were doing a good thing.”The 403(b) plans are much better for many educators in New Orleans now, and many teachers are able to invest in simple index funds. But Mr. Frailich remains unhappy with Voya and its attempt to profit from teachers who he believes would be better off in simpler, cheaper investments.He said that he understands that Voya has to answer to regulators and lawyers. But it would not be hard, he said, for the company to create a simple website for people like his clients who want to move their money — one with correct forms and electronic signatures that do not require faxes.“You could just push a button,” he said. “But if an institution has an incentive to hold on to your money, they are going to hold on to your money.”Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

THE COMMON GOOD By Robert B. Reich 193 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $22.95.In recent decades, American public discourse has become hollow and shrill. Instead of morally robust debates about the common good, we have shouting matches on talk radio and cable television, and partisan food fights in Congress. People argue past one another, without really listening or seeking to persuade.This condition has diminished the public’s regard for political parties and politicians, and also given rise to a danger: A politics empty of moral argument creates a vacuum of meaning that is often filled by the vengeful certitudes of strident nationalism. This danger now hovers over American politics. More than a year into the presidency of Donald Trump, however, liberals and progressives have yet to articulate a politics of the common good adequate to the country’s predicament.Robert B. Reich’s new book, “The Common Good,” is a welcome response to this challenge. One of the most prominent voices among progressives, Reich has written insightfully about the changing nature of work brought about by globalization and the growing inequality it has generated. He served as secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, but in 2016 endorsed Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton.Reich’s book diagnoses the decline of the common good in American life and suggests ways of restoring it. He begins by observing that even the term has fallen into disuse: “The common good is no longer a fashionable idea. The phrase is rarely uttered today, not even by commencement speakers and politicians.”AdvertisementReich defines the common good as consisting in “our shared values about what we owe one another as citizens who are bound together in the same society.” What binds us as Americans, he argues, is not birth or ethnicity but a commitment to fundamental ideals and principles: respect for the rule of law and democratic institutions, toleration of our differences and belief in equal political rights and equal opportunity.AdvertisementThese ideals and principles, Reich says, are not political, at least not in the partisan sense; to affirm them is not to take sides in debates between Democrats and Republicans. “We passionately disagree about all manner of things. But we must share these commitments to each other because they are — or have been — what makes us a people.”Reich attributes the erosion of the common good in recent decades to the breakdown of moral restraint in the pursuit of power and money. In Washington, the “whatever-it-takes-to-win politics” that began in the Nixon years has led to the hyperpartisanship of today. In the corporate world, the single-minded pursuit of shareholder value has displaced the older notion that companies are responsible for the well-being of workers, customers and the communities they serve.The unbridled pursuit of power and profit has brought an enormous flow of corporate money into politics. The result is a rigged system that perpetuates inequality, enables economic elites to manipulate the rules of the game to their own advantage, undermines trust in institutions and promotes attitudes of unrestrained self-seeking in social life generally.There are several ways to revive the common good, Reich suggests. One is to recover the notion of leadership as trusteeship. Corporate executives should recognize responsibilities beyond maximizing profits, and public officials should resist the scorched-earth, anything-goes approach to politics. The essence of Trump’s failure as a leader, according to Reich, is “not that he has chosen one set of policies over another, or has divided rather than united Americans, or even that he has behaved in childish and vindictive ways unbecoming a president. It is that he has sacrificed the processes and institutions of American democracy to achieve his goals.”Reich also calls for a greater emphasis on civic education, including two years of mandatory public service, and efforts to resurrect truth from the miasma of political deceit and fake news. Perhaps the most distinctive measure Reich proposes is the redeployment of honor and shame. Rather than honor people for their wealth or celebrity, we should honor those who display genuine virtue, like whistle-blowers, firefighters, social workers and soldiers — people who perform hard or risky tasks that serve the common good. And we should shame those who, however wealthy, achieve their status through exploitative business practices or morally dubious financial dealings.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.Interestingly, in developing this theme, Reich favorably cites so-called “virtue conservatives” of the 1980s and 1990s. For example, he quotes William J. Bennett, the education secretary in the Reagan administration, who warned that “nonjudgmentalism … has permeated our culture, encouraging a paralysis of the moral faculty.” He also cites the conservative political scientist James Q. Wilson, who argued that neglecting broken windows in poor communities conveys a message of moral license, leading to an unraveling of social restraints and increased crime. Reich contends that people who get rich by exploiting norms of social trust — by evading taxes, say, or devising barely legal schemes of financial trickery — generate a similar unraveling.Against the grain of much liberal thinking, Reich acknowledges that promoting civic virtue requires being judgmental about what moral attitudes and qualities of character our public life should affirm and promote. This recognition of the role of moral judgment in politics is an important corrective to the liberal wariness of bringing morality into the public square.Reich’s proposals would make a good starting point for a new progressive political project. What is puzzling, however, is his insistence that a politics of the common good can or should be nonpartisan. Time and again, he draws a sharp distinction between the common good he wants to revive and the competing conceptions of the common good at stake in everyday political debate — about tax policy, health care, the environment and so on. He insists his book is not about what messages Democrats or Republicans should convey or what policies they should pursue, but rather about restoring our shared commitment to democratic norms and principles. “It’s our agreement to these principles that connects us, not agreement about where these principles lead.”Reich seems to believe that the common good describes ground rules for a decent society, not the policies and purposes that citizens should pursue within these ground rules. But is it really possible to separate the two? Is the debate over how vigorously to regulate Wall Street about the ground rules of democracy or a policy on which Democrats and Republicans may reasonably disagree? Or consider immigration. Reich argues that the common good is “not about securing borders, erecting walls and keeping others out …. To the contrary, the common good is about inclusion — joining together to achieve common goals.” But inclusion of whom — existing citizens of the country, Dreamers, other immigrants who hope to be admitted? Partisans on all sides of this raging debate invoke competing conceptions of the common good to support their position.AdvertisementAs these examples suggest, the nonpartisan, above-the-fray conception of the common good that Reich proposes may be too high-minded to reinvigorate American public discourse in the way he wants. In the face of President Trump’s serial violations of democratic norms, it is tempting to appeal to Americans, whatever their party or political persuasion, to reaffirm certain principles that all can share. But such principles, if truly detached from debate about where they lead, are so abstract that they can only serve as hortatory fare for commencement addresses and the Fourth of July. The best hope for reviving the common good is to invigorate moral argument in the messy, contentious domain of democratic politics.Michael J.

business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersNEW YORK — U.S. job growth increased less than expected in April and the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent as some jobless Americans left the labour force.The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed wages barely rising last month, which could ease concerns that inflation pressures were rapidly building up, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening.HIGHLIGHTS:*April U.S. nonfarm payrolls up 164,000, versus consensus of up 192,000, and upwardly revised March gain of 135,000 *U.S. April labour force participation rate 62.8 percent vs March 62.9 percent*April jobless rate 3.9 percent, below consensus for 4.0 percent and March's 4.1 percent *April average hourly earnings for all private workers was up 0.1 pct, below consensus for up 0.2 pct and March's downwardly revise March 0.2 percent gain. COMMENTS:QUINCY KROSBY, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL""Today’s report underscores the tug-of-war in the market: is the weaker headline number and slight contraction in wages an indication of economic growth slowing, or is it another sign of the labour market reaching full employment.""""Positive for markets is that Treasury yields have pulled back, the dollar weakened, and fears of wage-induced inflation marching higher have been assuaged by this report.""""Still, the tug-of-war will continue as market participants need evidence that the economic backdrop remains robust, while the 3.9 percent unemployment rate suggests an economy that is creating enough jobs for qualified workers.""""This report will fade into today’s trading session as market participants wait for headlines stemming from trade talks in China.""STEVEN ENGLANDER, HEARD OF RESEARCH AND STRATEGY, RAFIKI CAPITAL, NEW YORK:""I think next week we are going to see a bunch of Fed speakers expressing confidence in the economy, basically telling the market that they drew the wrong conclusion from the statement. I think that this is going to blow over, but for today the market, on a scale of minus 10 to plus 10 on where the market views these numbers, they are not catastrophic, but they are probably at minus 3 or minus 4. Given that the market is long dollars, they are bit short bonds and concerned on equities, we might get an exaggerated reaction today just because the numbers are hitting the market at a vulnerable point.""CHRIS GAFFNEY, PRESIDENT OF WORLD MARKETS, EVERBANK, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI“I think this does nothing to change the Fed. It will hike in June. The economy is healthy but not overheating. Wages are not moving. We are not seeing wage pressure, which we need to see before the Fed accelerates in rate-hike path. The dollar is giving back some of its gains and Treasury yields are falling. This is a good report for the stock market with the unemployment rate below 4 percent which should give consumers some confidence.”ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, B. RILEY FBR, NEW YORK""The more interesting reaction is going to be in the yields. You see the 2 and 10 year backing out a little bit."" ""It was a mixed report. The headline numbers are disappointing but there's nothing scary about inflation. There was fewer jobs created in the last month than consensus but the month before was revised higher. That makes this a benign report.  Average hourly earnings increased but by less than expectations.""""We've yet to see a pick up in employment as it pertains to the tax reform but that may be structural in terms of the job openings that exist being difficult to fill.""""I think its not going to be a market moving event today and we'll focus on any messaging around trade talks with China.""COLLIN MARTIN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, SCHWAB CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH, NEW YORK“The headline jobless rate dropping below 4 percent will grab some attention. But looking beyond that, most of the details came in relatively weak. This is a bit disappointing on the earnings front after the employment cost index we received last week. Still this is not enough for the Fed to pause. They will still hike in the June meeting. If people were worried about a faster pace of hike. This report should calm those concerns. We are seeing yields dropping across the curve. The curve will likely resume its flattening bias in the long term, but it won’t invert in the foreseeable future. We see some forces that could push up long-term yields such as Treasury supply in the near term.”  MICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON “It’s a goldilocks number in that the top line missed a little bit from consensus expectations however you had the unemployment rate drop below 4 percent, lowest rate since December of 2000. The key, I think to every single month’s jobs report continues to be the average hourly earnings. Investors continue to look there for signs of inflation and we really didn’t get any. ""Particularly given the length of this particular business cycle, job growth at these levels continues to be quite strong, and the fact we are not seeing a material pickup in wages continues to be the mystery of the jobs reports. The economy can withstand growing jobs – the three-month average is a little north of 200,000 with an unemployment rate below 4 percent – that signals the U.S. economy labour market continues to be on solid ground."" ""I don’t see this particular report changing the Fed’s path or the recent trend. You have signs the labour market continues to be strong. The Fed will continue to scratch its collective head on why wages aren’t growing, they continue to believe that has to happen and we are still in that dynamic. But with that, even with this week’s FOMC meeting and subsequent release, the Fed showed no indications of altering its path towards rate hikes this year.”MARKET REACTION:STOCKS: Stocks slightly pared losses.

BONDS: Benchmark yields eased, with the ten-year last at 2.9141.FOREX: The dollar cut modest gains, with the dollar index against a basket of currencies last up 0.14 percent.

Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • What to expect from Powell’s first Fed meeting.• Trump, tariffs and the G20.• Pressure continues to mount on Facebook.• Facebook had a terrible day.• So did Uber.• Leaders at the G-20 summit are still trying to avert a trade war.Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here.Federal Reserve policymakers conclude their March rate-setting meeting on Wednesday. It is the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank’s new chairman.With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year.AdvertisementAfter the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.AdvertisementHere’s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting:Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs: “Public remarks by Fed officials suggest a broad shift in the committee’s outlook towards a potentially faster pace of tightening, and we expect the median dot to show four hikes in 2018, up from three at the December meeting. Additional hawkish changes—a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer-run funds rate estimates—are also possible but not our base case.”Michelle Meyer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Ms. Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting, but “unlike December where there were two dissents, we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction. The focus will be on the evolution of the dots: we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year, but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019. We also think the long-run dot will edge up to 2.875%. This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes, but without an urgency to front-load the tightening.”Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics: Mr. Powell “is bound to be faced with questions along the lines of “Why are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial, unfunded fiscal easing?”. His reply, we suspect, will be something like: “It’s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy, and it’s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases. Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent, and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up, so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation. In any event, with inflation well below target, gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening.”Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont: “The bulk of the interest in this week’s F.O.M.C. meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F.O.M.C. statement. Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction, though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different.”Steve Rick, CUNA Mutual Group: There is “a very strong case for not only raising rates this week, but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017. I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three, with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well.”Chris Zaccarelli, Independent Advisor Alliance: “Whether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn’t be that big of a difference to the economy, but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology. Every statement – whether spoken or written – will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1% higher (or only 75 bps) a year from now.”President Trump’s plan to hit countries around the world with stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum has dominated a gathering of world economic leaders amid fears that the United States is on the cusp of starting an international trade war.AdvertisementOn Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security.In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced “relatively quickly.”Mr. Mnuchin said:“I think we’ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don’t think anything should be a surprise. This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.”Mr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States’ national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.Countries including France, Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr. Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs, arguing that, as United States allies, they should not be penalized on national security grounds. Mr. Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case-by-case basis and that there was not a one-size-fits-all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt. The tariffs go into effect on Friday.— Alan RappeportThe Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy, reports Cecilia Kang of the NYT.The probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The investigation, started in recent days, adds to the mounting pressureagainst Facebook in the United States and in the United Kingdom about its handling of the data. Cambridge Analytica used the information to help President Trump’s presidential campaign profile voters during the 2016 election.The F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers “by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,” according to a statement at the time.AdvertisementFacebook could face fines of thousands of dollars a day per violation if the commission finds Facebook violated terms of the settlement, Bloomberg reports.Shares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading.Exhibit A: Its stock closed down nearly 7 percent, its worst performance in four years.Exhibit B: Its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, plans to leave after disagreements about how much the company should share about misuse of its platform. (He favored disclosure.)The overall problem: Reports about how the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users are highlighting just how much governments itch to regulate the tech giant.And Facebook’s previous laissez-faire attitude toward data collection by apps has gone from feature to bug, Kevin Roose writes in his latest column.Peter Eavis’s take: Mark Zuckerberg’s unusually powerful position at the company may have played a role:Through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.More on Cambridge Analytica: An undercover investigation by Channel 4 News of Britain captured the firm’s C.E.O., Alexander Nix, suggesting the entrapment of a potential client’s political opponents with women and bribes. Britain’s information commissioner is now seeking a warrant to examine the firm’s data. And Facebook has hired a forensics firm to audit it.Critics’ corner• Jeff Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes, “Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his start-up into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.”• The academic Zeynep Tufekci writes, “This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.”Advertisement• Cass Sunstein of Bloomberg View writes, “It would be a mistake to take the fiasco as a reason to keep treasure troves of information out of the hands of people who can provide immensely valuable services with it.”• Dan Gallagher of Heard on the Street writes, “Facebook’s immense scale also has made it virtually impossible for alternatives to catch on. That, in turn, makes abuse of the platform more urgent for lawmakers.”Public service announcements: How to protect yourself on Facebook. Oxford Analytica, an advisory group, wants you to know it’s not like that. And a little joke for those steeped in the British university system:Uber has suspended its autonomous vehicle testing in four cities after a car in self-driving mode struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Ariz. Until now, regulators had been increasingly open to testing: Just this month, California said it would start letting self-driving cars operate without anyone behind the wheel. Arizona already had.The head of Carnegie Mellon’s self-driving car lab has urged a halt to testing, telling Axios, “The technology is not there yet.”The virtual currencies corner: The White House banned Venezuela’s virtual currency in a new round of sanctions.

Sign up here.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.AdvertisementStocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.AdvertisementStill, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we’ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company’s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won’t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla’s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla’s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap’s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.— Peter EavisThe reason?AdvertisementReports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.Jonathan Swan of Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported:“Trump has talked about changing Amazon’s tax treatment because he’s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.”Mr. Swan added:“Trump’s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.”Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday, but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment. But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues.How concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:“While it’s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company’s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.”Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon's woes? Retailers, the FT points out.On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy’s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl’s was up 2.4 percent.The electric carmaker’s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.Tuesday’s slide was driven, in part, by the National Transportation Safety Board’s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California. News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit probably didn't help either.But the continued decline in Tesla’s stock — its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March — speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3. Late Tuesday, Moody’s downgraded Tesla’s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative. The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than $2 billion.Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla’s stock price but also in the trading of its debt. The FT points out that “Tesla’s eight-year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87.6 cents to the dollar, the lowest since issuance. The yield has surged to 7.5 percent from 6.59 percent on Monday.”Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:“Challenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.“Given Tuesday’s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?”The fallout from Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research’s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.

Near-Term target $25 Of all social media, they are most vulnerable to privacy regulation Wait until Senate finds out what Citron has published. https://t.co/nAkRWb8Kcn But analysts at Barclays disagree. They argue in a recent note to clients that Twitter’s data business likely won’t be impacted much by any regulation on its use of user data. The credit reporting company named Mark Begor, a private equity executive who once led General Electric’s credit card business, as its new chief executive.AdvertisementMr. Begor, 59, takes over for Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., who has filled the role on an interim basis since September, when Richard F. Smith stepped down after a data breach exposed sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, of 148 million people.Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.About Mr. Begor• The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO.• Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate’s real-estate investment and energy management units. For nine years, he was president and chief executive of the company’s consumer credit business, which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial.His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million.President Trump has scored a significant trade deal with South Korea.But with Mr. Trump preparing to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un — who just took an armored train trip to Beijing — and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments, an “America first” trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign. More from Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport:The political success of the trade agreement — and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations — is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington’s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president’s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China. Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. tech. A separate plan to enact tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted. Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war, the WSJ reports.And nations are already reacting to Trump’s trade moves, erecting  barriers to stop the steel and aluminum that faces tariffs in the U.S. being dumped in their markets.AdvertisementAgainst this background, NXP sold its 40 percent stake in a Chinese joint venture on chip design.Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.But that confidence is evaporating, as investors brace for intensified regulatory scrutiny across the industry. Tech stocks took a pummeling yesterday and in early European trading.Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left’s Citron Research said it was shorting the company.Critic’s corner: The “sector’s growing clout over everyday life also raises the risks of what can go wrong,” Dan Gallagher argues at WSJ’s Heard on the Street.The public outcry over Facebook’s data and privacy settings has grown loud enough that Mark Zuckerberg now says he’s willing to testify to Congress.

Its shares dropped 7.8 percent.Here’s Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics:Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.Tesla also tumbled 8.2 percent, after the National Transportation Safety Board said it was conducting its second crash investigation of the year involving one of the company’s cars.

The subtitle is no overstatement: In the early 1920s, first in Paris and then back home in São Paulo, Brazil, this painter really did lay the groundwork for the coming of modernism in Latin America’s most populous nation. Tired of the European pretenders in Brazil’s art academies, Tarsila (who was always called by her first name) began to intermingle Western, African and indigenous motifs into flowing, biomorphic paintings, and to theorize a new national culture fueled by the principle of antropofagia, or “cannibalism.” Along with spare, assured drawings of Rio and the Brazilian countryside, this belated but very welcome show assembles Tarsila’s three most important paintings, including the classic “Abaporu” (1928): a semi-human nude with a spindly nose and a comically swollen foot.

The offerings at this annual event, which features 45 free public exhibitions, are as diverse and intriguing as the continent it represents. On view across Manhattan, as well as from Staten Island to New Haven, the work ranges from religious statuary to textiles, prints and paintings. The collection of ceramics by the excellent 20th-century potter Kamoda Shoji at Joan B. Mirviss is a notable highlight. An added bonus: The pieces have never been shown outside of Japan. (Peter Libbey)asiaweekny.com‘THE BEAUTIFUL BRAIN: THE DRAWINGS OF SANTIAGO RAMÓN Y CAJAL’ at Grey Art Gallery (through March 31). The first United States museum exhibition devoted to the scientific illustrations of this Spanish giant of neuroscience is among the year’s best so far. Its 80 freehand renderings of different brain cells, as viewed through a microscope, helped prove that they are unconnected, communicating across tiny gaps called synaptic clefts, which earned Cajal a Nobel Prize in 1906. His exquisite images, still used in textbooks, ignite synaptic charges throughout 20th-century art, from Surrealism onward. (Roberta Smith)212-998-6780, greyartgallery.nyu.edu‘BIRDS OF A FEATHER: JOSEPH CORNELL’S HOMAGE TO JUAN GRIS’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through April 15). This small, hyper-specialized, stunning exhibition brings together a grand total of only 13 works — a dozen shadow boxes by Joseph Cornell, the Queens-based assemblage artist, and the Cubist masterwork that he cited as their direct inspiration, Gris’s “Man at the Café” (1914). It might seem like a surprising obsession for Cornell, who was not a painter nor a Frenchman. He and Gris never met. But Cornell was deeply moved by Gris, the overlooked, tag-along third wheel in the Cubist movement that also included Picasso and Braque, and the show succeeds in tracking the fluttery ways of artistic inspiration. (Deborah Solomon)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘DIAMOND MOUNTAINS: TRAVEL AND NOSTALGIA IN KOREAN ART’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 20). Mount Kumgang, or the “Diamond Mountain,” lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang’s Olympic Stadium, but it’s a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. Featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, this melancholy beauty of a show assembles three centuries’ worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘THE FACE OF DYNASTY: ROYAL CRESTS FROM WESTERN CAMEROON’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 3). In the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster in its own right. These massive wooden crests — in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows — served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met’s recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a “sculpture” divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was crafted from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and story boards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago)718-784-0077, movingimage.us‘PETER HUJAR: SPEED OF LIFE’ at the Morgan Library and Museum (through May 20). It’s hard to say which is more surprising: that Peter Hujar’s photographs of underground life in New York in the 1970s and ’80s have found their way to the Morgan Library and Museum, or that the classically minded institution has become unbuttoned enough to exhibit them in this heartbreaker of a show. Hujar (1934-87) lived most of his professional life in the East Village and, through studio portraits and cityscapes, captured a downtown that has since been all but erased by time, gentrification and AIDS. Although he was little known by the mainstream art world in his lifetime, this show, startlingly tender, reveals him to be one of the major American photographers of the late 20th century. (Holland Cotter) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org‘THE INCOMPLETE ARAKI’ at the Museum of Sex (through Aug. 31). It remains a bit of a tourist trap, but the for-profit Museum of Sex is making its most serious bid yet for artistic credibility with a two-floor exhibition of Japan’s most prominent and controversial photographer. Nobuyoshi Araki has spent decades shooting Tokyo streetscapes, blossoming flowers and, notably, women trussed up in the baroque rope bondage technique known as kinbaku-bi, or “the beauty of tight binding.” Given the venue, it’s natural that this show concentrates on the erotic side of his art, but less lustful visitors can discover an ambitious cross section of Mr. Araki’s omnivorous photography, including his lastingly moving “Sentimental Journey,” picturing his beloved wife, Yoko, from honeymoon to funeral. (Farago)212-689-6337, museumofsex.com‘ZOE LEONARD: SURVEY’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through June 10). Some shows cast a spell. Zoe Leonard’s reverberant retrospective does. Physically ultra-austere, all white walls with a fiercely edited selection of objects — photographs of clouds taken from airplane windows; a mural collaged from vintage postcards; a scattering of empty fruit skins, each stitched closed with needle and thread — it’s an extended essay about travel, time passing, political passion and the ineffable daily beauty of the world. (Cotter)212-570-3600, whitney.org‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through Nov. 4). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith)212-708-9400, moma.org‘MADE IN ASIA’ at Opera Gallery (through March 27). Running parallel to Asia Week, this exhibition brings together a globe-spanning collection of works from or inspired by Asia. It includes Yue Minjun’s “The Ressurection” and “Everywhere,” a video robot sculpture by Korean-American artist Nam June Paik and Warhol’s “Mao” silkscreen. (Danielle Dowling)646-707-3299, operagallery.com ‘MILLENNIUM: LOWER MANHATTAN IN THE 1990S’ at the Skyscraper Museum (through April). This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico’s at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished. (Farago)skyscraper.org‘OUTLIERS AND AMERICAN VANGUARD ART’ at the National Gallery of Art, Washington (through May 13). Tracing the interaction of taught and untaught artists over the past century, this exhibition tackles an impossibly immense subject and starts stronger than it finishes. But it presents quantities of stunning art in all mediums, revealing the vastness of American creativity and the many attempts by museums to do it justice. It proves more forcefully than ever that the distinction between the works of the self-taught and that of the professionals has outlived its relevance.

Delve into the ties that bound these progressive standard-bearers through photographs that document their rise to the national stage in the 1950s and ’60s and the struggle for the societal changes they championed, and ephemera such as magazines, campaign buttons, protest placards and an R.F.K.-M.L.K. spinning pendant. You can even listen on a transistor radio to the song Dick Holler wrote after their assassinations in 1968, “Abraham, Martin and John.” (Dowling)212-873-3400, nyhistory.org‘ALBERTO SAVINIO’ at the Center for Italian Modern Art (through June 23). The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico. This show of more than 20 canvases from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s may not change that, but the mix of landscapes with bright patterns and several eerie portraits based on family photographs are surprisingly of the moment. (Smith)646-370-3596, italianmodernart.org‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago)212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org‘STEPHEN SHORE’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 28). Not staged, not lit, not cropped, not retouched, the color photographs of this American master are feats of dispassionate representation. This must-see retrospective — curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA’s photo chief — opens with Mr. Shore’s teenage snaps at Andy Warhol’s Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of “American Surfaces” and the steely precision of “Uncommon Places” — landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA’s smudged iPads. New technologies are great, but not at the expense of concentration. (Farago)212-708-9400, moma.org‘2018 TRIENNIAL: SONGS FOR SABOTAGE’ at the New Museum (through May 27). This Bowery museum’s fourth triennial exhibition, “Songs for Sabotage,” is the smallest, tightest edition of the show so far. Immaculately installed, it’s also the best looking. There’s a lot of good work, which is global in scope and not by a list of prevetted up-and-comers. (Zhenya Machneva, Dalton Paula and Daniela Ortiz are artists to look for.) Less admirably, it’s a safe and unchallenging show. Despite a politically demanding time, it acts as if ambiguity and discretion were automatically virtues. In an era when the market rules, it puts its money on the kind of art — easily tradable, displayable, palette-tickling objects — that art fairs suck up. (Cotter)212-219-1222, newmuseum.org‘THE VIETNAM WAR: 1945-1975’ at the New-York Historical Society (through April 22). In contrast to the PBS series “The Vietnam War,” this exhibition delivers historical data, a lot of it, quick and dirty, through labels, film and audio clips and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art. Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, there’s graffiti-style drawings on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in album covers and protest posters. Words and images work together in murals labeled “Home Front” and “War Front” that put you in the middle of the war’s primary issues and events. (Cotter)212-873-3400, nyhistory.org‘HOTBED’ at the New-York Historical Society (through March 25). Celebrating the centennial of the passage of women’s voting rights in New York State, this exhibition at the museum’s Joyce B. Cowin Women’s History Gallery assembles more than 100 images and artifacts, including advocative posters; progressive magazines of the time, such as The Woman Voter; and cookbooks and pepper shakers bearing suffragist propaganda. These items tell the story of the women’s rights movement in the early 20th century — its evolution, its impact and its epicenter in Greenwich Village.

business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLONDON/BENGALURU — Spotify Technology SA missed the beat on Wednesday. The streaming music leader fell short of investor hopes that it could turn free music listeners into paying subscribers at a faster clip, and its shares dropped as much as 9 percent.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading ahead of its first report as a public company, and analysts said expectations may have become overblown. They voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company's average revenue per user. First-quarter revenue also fell shy of analysts' average forecasts.The Swedish company, which began trading in an unorthodox direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange in April, reported steady growth by most financial measures but failed to deliver the commanding performance that could justify the bullish stock recommendations published in the days ahead of the results.Spotify said paid subscriptions for the second quarter would range between 79 million and 83 million, which at the midpoint was below Wall Street's consensus forecast of 81.79 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said Spotify appears to be discounting many full-price music subscriptions and extending the length of free-trial plans to convert free, advertising supported users into paying subscribers.Average revenue per user in the first quarter fell to 4.72 euros, down from around 6.84 euros towards the end of 2015.""It looks like there may be too many discounts and too high a percentage of premium subs may be in for the cheaper family and student plans,"" Mogharabi said.Shares of Spotify ran up 14 percent from their first day of trade a month ago, closing at $170 ahead of its first quarter financial report. Afterward, the stock was trading at $155.50, down 8.5 percent at 2245 GMT/6:45 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Spotify reported first-quarter revenue of 1.139 billion euros ($1.36 billion), up 26 percent from a year earlier, or 37 percent excluding currency effects. The revenue was broadly in line with the 1.10 billion euros to 1.15 billion euros the company had forecast but just short of the 1.143 billion euro consensus estimate among 13 analysts.""Results and guidance are pretty much exactly in line with expectations, but the stock reaction clearly suggests investors were hoping for a little more,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said. One soft spot was slow growth in North America, Cordwell said, which despite Spotify's global reach could be seen as a gauge for how well it is competing for subscriptions with Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc.Spotify, which launched its streaming music service a decade ago, has enjoyed a surge in subscriber growth only in recent years. Since launching in 2015, Apple Music has grown rapidly to 40 million paid users and 8 million trial users and is looking to overtake Spotify in the lucrative North American market. Amazon Music, the No. 3 player in the global streaming music outside China, does not disclose exact figures but reported last week it had ""tens of millions of paid customers"" and that subscriptions grew more than 100 percent in the last six months. The Swedish company said it expected revenue for the second quarter of between 1.1 billion and 1.3 billion euros, up 10 percent to 29 percent year on year, including foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding currency effects, Spotify expects revenue growth of 20 percent to 38 percent. It projected gross margins of between 24 percent and 26 percent, roughly in line with the 24.9 percent margin it reported in first quarter.MUSICAL REVIVALOn Wednesday, Spotify kept its outlook for full year 2018 unchanged, with monthly active users rising to between 198 million and 208 million. It posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago. Spotify said it had 170 million active monthly users at the end of March, up 30 percent from the year-ago quarter. The rising popularity of Spotify's subscription services have led stock market investors to once again prize the music industry after shunning it for more than a decade amid a wave of piracy by users and in the face of major technology shifts.France’s Vivendi, the owner of Universal Music Group, the world’s biggest music label, said recently it is mulling a stock market listing of its wholly owned music unit.Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), which attracts three-quarters of China’s booming music-streaming market, has been reported to be eyeing a listing in 2018. TME is controlled by internet giant Tencent and also holds a stake in Spotify.Revenue from free, advertising-supported services which Spotify uses to woo new listeners to the service in order to eventually convert them to paying members, grew to 102 million euros in the first quarter, up 38 percent, year-over year. Advertising sales are a tenth of what it makes from subscribers.

business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersWARSAW — Polish debt collector GetBack has so far failed to redeem bonds worth $25 million (18 million pounds), it said on Thursday, augmenting worries about the remaining $719 million worth of bonds of a firm that only last year used to be a darling of capital markets.The sudden crash of the bonds and shares of GetBack has taken investors, analysts and regulators by surprise, weighing on share prices of other listed firms. The ratings agency Fitch cut its rating for GetBack's debt to 'restricted default' on Thursday.""The downgrade reflects Fitch's view that the partial non-payment on bonds (...) constitutes an uncured payment default,"" the rating agency said. Earlier this week, Poland's financial regulator KNF asked prosecutors to investigate GetBack, adding that nearly 200 institutions and over 9,000 retail investors held the firm's bonds. The company's shares have lost nearly 90 percent of their value since October. GetBack debuted in the stock market in July last year, attracting investors with its aggressive growth strategy. The firm bought up large portfolios of distressed debt at much higher prices than its competitors at a time of robust economic growth in Poland, coupled by record low unemployment and quickly rising wages.Several respected brokerages had a 'buy' recommendation on GetBack shares until late last year. The mBank DM brokerage, indirectly controlled by Germany's Commerzbank, had recommended buying GetBack shares in November last year, praising the company's ""above average effectiveness"" and setting a target price of 33.4 zlotys (7 pounds). The recommendation was suspended on Apr. 16.The shares of GetBack have since plunged to 3.75 zlotys and trading was indefinitely suspended by the regulator last week. In February this year, GetBack said that rating agency S&P Global changed the outlook on the firm's B rating to 'positive', citing the growth outlook. S&P has since cut the outlook to negative and suspended the rating altogether.GetBack Chief Executive Konrad Kakolewski was dismissed earlier this month.The troubles of GetBack, which is controlled by the private equity funds led by Abris Capital Partners, have dragged down shares of other listed firms, including investment fund Quercus TFI.GetBack had been planning share issues worth up to 70 percent of existing capital and said last week the new board was aiming to restore investors' trust in the company.

The subtitle is no overstatement: In the early 1920s, first in Paris and then back home in São Paulo, Brazil, this painter really did lay the groundwork for the coming of modernism in Latin America’s most populous nation. Tired of the European pretenders in Brazil’s art academies, Tarsila (who was always called by her first name) began to intermingle Western, African and indigenous motifs into flowing, biomorphic paintings, and to theorize a new national culture fueled by the principle of antropofagia, or “cannibalism.” Along with spare, assured drawings of Rio and the Brazilian countryside, this belated but very welcome show assembles Tarsila’s three most important paintings, including the classic “Abaporu” (1928): a semi-human nude with a spindly nose and a comically swollen foot. (Jason Farago)212-708-9400, moma.org‘BEFORE THE FALL: GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN ART OF THE 1930S’ at Neue Galerie (through May 28). An exhibition in the form of a chokehold, the third of the Neue Galerie’s recent shows on art and German politics pushes into the years of dictatorship, with paintings, drawings and photographs by artists deemed “degenerate” by the Nazis — as well as by those who joined the party or who thought they could shut out the catastrophe. (You will know the dissidents, like Max Beckmann and Oskar Kokoschka; the fascists and sellouts are less known.) Gazing at macabre still lifes of dolls and dead flowers, or dreamy landscapes in imitation of an earlier German Romanticism, you may ask to what degree artists are responsible for the times in which they work. But then you see “Self-Portrait in the Camp,” by the Jewish German painter Felix Nussbaum — made between his escape from a French internment camp and his deportation to Auschwitz — and you know that there can be no pardon. (Farago)212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org‘HUMA BHABHA: WE COME IN PEACE’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 28). This spare and unsettling sculptural installation for the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden Commission includes two figures: one that is somewhat humanoid but with a ferocious mask-face and that visually dwarfs the jagged Manhattan skyline behind it, and another bowing in supplication or prayer, with long cartoonish human hands and a scraggly tail emerging from its shiny, black drapery. The title is a variant on the line an alien uttered to an anxious crowd in the 1951 science-fiction movie “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” but it ripples with other associations: colonization, invasion, imperialism or missionaries and other foreigners whose intentions were not always innocent. The installation also feels like an extension of the complex, cross-cultural conversation going on downstairs, inside a museum packed with 5,000 years of art history. (Martha Schwendener)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘THOMAS COLE’S JOURNEY: ATLANTIC CROSSING’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 13). The Met’s exhibition of the nation’s first major landscape artist and progenitor of what would be called the Hudson River School is gorgeous, politically right for right now and a lesson in the mutability of art history. Politically, Cole’s art is conservative, but it’s also work that challenges and complicates that term. And this show is precisely about complication. Just as Cole is most realistically and revealingly seen and judged against the background of his time, so is the exhibition, coming as it does in this confounding MAGA moment. (Holland Cotter)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘DIAMOND MOUNTAINS: TRAVEL AND NOSTALGIA IN KOREAN ART’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 20). Mount Kumgang, or the “Diamond Mountain,” lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang’s Olympic Stadium, but it’s a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. Featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, this melancholy beauty of a show assembles three centuries’ worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘THE FACE OF DYNASTY: ROYAL CRESTS FROM WESTERN CAMEROON’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 3). In the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster in its own right. These massive wooden crests — in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows — served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met’s recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a “sculpture” divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and story boards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago)718-784-0077, movingimage.us‘PETER HUJAR: SPEED OF LIFE’ at the Morgan Library and Museum (through May 20). It’s hard to say which is more surprising: that Peter Hujar’s photographs of underground life in New York in the 1970s and ’80s have found their way to the Morgan Library and Museum, or that the classically minded institution has become unbuttoned enough to exhibit them in this heartbreaker of a show. Hujar (1934-87) lived most of his professional life in the East Village and, through studio portraits and cityscapes, captured a downtown that has since been all but erased by time, gentrification and AIDS. Although he was little known by the mainstream art world in his lifetime, this show, startlingly tender, reveals him to be one of the major American photographers of the late 20th century. (Cotter) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org‘THE INCOMPLETE ARAKI’ at the Museum of Sex (through Aug. 31). It remains a bit of a tourist trap, but the for-profit Museum of Sex is making its most serious bid yet for artistic credibility with a two-floor exhibition of Japan’s most prominent and controversial photographer. Nobuyoshi Araki has spent decades shooting Tokyo streetscapes, blossoming flowers and, notably, women trussed up in the baroque rope bondage technique known as kinbaku-bi, or “the beauty of tight binding.” Given the venue, it’s natural that this show concentrates on the erotic side of his art, but less lustful visitors can discover an ambitious cross section of Mr. Araki’s omnivorous photography, including his lastingly moving “Sentimental Journey,” picturing his beloved wife, Yoko, from honeymoon to funeral. (Farago)212-689-6337, museumofsex.com‘ZOE LEONARD: SURVEY’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through June 10). Some shows cast a spell. Zoe Leonard’s reverberant retrospective does. Physically ultra-austere, all white walls with a fiercely edited selection of objects — photographs of clouds taken from airplane windows; a mural collaged from vintage postcards; a scattering of empty fruit skins, each stitched closed with needle and thread — it’s an extended essay about travel, time passing, political passion and the ineffable daily beauty of the world. (Cotter)212-570-3600, whitney.org‘LIKE LIFE: SCULPTURE, COLOR AND THE BODY (1300 TO NOW)’ at the Met Breuer (through July 22). Taking a second run at the splashy theme-show extravaganza, the Met Breuer has greater success. This one is certainly more coherent since it centers entirely on the body and its role in art, science, religion and entertainment. It gathers together some 120 sculptures, dolls, artist’s dummies, effigies, crucifixes and automatons. Many are rarely lent and may not return any time soon. (Roberta Smith)212-731-1675, metmuseum.org‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through Nov. 4). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith)212-708-9400, moma.org‘SALLY MANN: A THOUSAND CROSSINGS’ at the National Gallery of Art, Washington (through May 28). All of this photographer’s strengths are on view in this deftly chosen and admirably displayed exhibition that covers most of her 40-plus-year career. The 108 images here (47 of which have never been exhibited before) provide a provocative tour through Ms. Mann’s accomplishments and serve as a record of exploration — into the past, into this country’s and photography’s history, stamped with a powerful vision. (Vicki Goldberg)202-737-4215, nga.gov‘THE METROPOLIS IN LATIN AMERICA, 1830-1930’ at Americas Society (through June 30). Fans of Latin American architecture are overly besotted with the modernist era: Luis Barragán’s color-saturated houses in Mexico City, Oscar Niemeyer’s cutting-edge presidential palace in Brasília. But this eye-opening show turns the clock back 100 years and shows how six cities — Buenos Aires; Havana; Lima, Peru; Mexico City; Rio de Janeiro; and Santiago, Chile — used architecture and urban design to express new national ambitions. Vintage photographs disclose how in Mexico’s sprawling capital its new republican government erected statues of Cuauhtémoc, the last Aztec emperor, while Argentina plowed out lordly avenues in imitation of Haussmann-era Paris. All these cities had keen architectural ambitions, though if you have to pick the most sophisticated, it’s Rio in a landslide. Stare at Marc Ferrez’s jaw-dropping 1895 panoramic photograph of the erstwhile Brazilian capital, with Sugarloaf Mountain looming over Botafogo and Flamengo, and book the next flight. (Farago)212-249-8950, as-coa.org‘MILLENNIUM: LOWER MANHATTAN IN THE 1990S’ at the Skyscraper Museum (through June 24). This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico’s at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished. (Farago)skyscraper.org‘REBEL SPIRITS: ROBERT F. KENNEDY AND MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 20). Featuring stark black-and-white photographs of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as faded ephemera that memorialized them, this exhibition reveals the various ways in which the lives of these two influential figures were juxtaposed. It also traces the circuitous routes that belatedly pointed Kennedy toward the more incendiary goals King set first regarding civil rights, poverty and the Vietnam War. (Sam Roberts) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org‘ALBERTO SAVINIO’ at the Center for Italian Modern Art (through June 23). The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico. This show of more than 20 canvases from the late 1920s to the mid-30s may not change that, but the mix of landscapes with bright patterns and several eerie portraits based on family photographs are surprisingly of the moment. (Smith)646-370-3596, italianmodernart.org‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago)212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org‘STEPHEN SHORE’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 28). Not staged, not lit, not cropped, not retouched, the color photographs of this American master are feats of dispassionate representation. This must-see retrospective — curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA’s photo chief — opens with Mr. Shore’s teenage snaps at Andy Warhol’s Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of “American Surfaces” and the steely precision of “Uncommon Places” — landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA’s smudged iPads. New technologies are great, but not at the expense of concentration. (Farago)212-708-9400, moma.org‘2018 TRIENNIAL: SONGS FOR SABOTAGE’ at the New Museum (through May 27). This Bowery museum’s fourth triennial exhibition, “Songs for Sabotage,” is the smallest, tightest edition of the show so far. Immaculately installed, it’s also the best looking. There’s a lot of good work, which is global in scope and not by a list of prevetted up-and-comers. (Zhenya Machneva, Dalton Paula and Daniela Ortiz are artists to look for.) Less admirably, it’s a safe and unchallenging show. Despite a politically demanding time, it acts as if ambiguity and discretion were automatically virtues. In an era when the market rules, it puts its money on the kind of art — easily tradable, displayable, palette-tickling objects — that art fairs suck up. (Cotter)212-219-1222, newmuseum.org‘GRANT WOOD: AMERICAN GOTHIC AND OTHER FABLES’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through June 10). This well-done survey begins with the American Regionalist’s little-known efforts as an Arts and Crafts designer and touches just about every base. It includes his mural studies, book illustrations and most of his best-known paintings — including “American Gothic” and “The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.” Best of all are Wood’s smooth undulant landscapes with their plowmen and spongy trees and infectious serenity. (Smith) 212-570-3600, whitney.org‘OUTLIERS AND AMERICAN VANGUARD ART’ at the National Gallery of Art, Washington (through May 13). Tracing the interaction of taught and untaught artists over the past century, this exhibition tackles an impossibly immense subject and starts stronger than it finishes. But it presents quantities of stunning art in all mediums, revealing the vastness of American creativity and the many attempts by museums to do it justice. It proves more forcefully than ever that the distinction between the works of the self-taught and that of the professionals has outlived its usefulness. (Smith)202-737-4215, nga.gov‘DAHN VO: TAKE MY BREATH AWAY’ at the Guggenheim Museum (through May 9). This is the first museum survey of the Vietnam-born Danish artist, who draws his art from his life and the history he has lived through, recycling family mementos, found letters and artifacts, as well as random materials, into a very spare, poetic and astute study of power, colonialism, and the lives of refugees and of objects. The Guggenheim’s rotunda looks nearly empty at times, and there are lots of labels to read, but it is ultimately worth it. (Smith) 212-423-3500, guggenheim.orgAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.In the end, the wheelers and dealers faded away, trying to get what they could under cover of darkness. Their loss of stature was abrupt. Only those willing to soldier on as subordinates remained, ceding authority to their leader, President Trump.For four decades, from 1968 to 2008, what was loosely described as the Republican establishment — the party’s congressional leaders, campaign operatives, donors, lobbyists and special interests — reigned supreme.Every four years, the party’s presidential nominee secured the establishment’s stamp of approval. Endorsements from governors and senators — and a gigantic campaign chest fed by major Republican fund-raisers — were the main markers of that approval.In a party deeply committed to hierarchy, the establishment-favored candidate was always the next in line, often the vice president (George H.W. Bush in 1988) or the candidate who had come in second (or a very close third) in the previous contested nomination battle (Ronald Reagan 1980, Bob Dole 1996, John McCain 2008 and Mitt Romney 2012).Now, the Republican establishment, embodied in the Bush family, proud but powerless, is a relic of a past, brought to its knees by insurgent forces, not least of which is the ascendance of social media.[Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]“The Republican Party today is very much an outsiders’ party,” Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary for the last anointed president, George W. Bush, said in an interview. “The mood of the party is ‘pound the table’ and say ‘everybody who has been on the inside is part of the problem’. ”John Feehery, a lobbyist who served as a top aide to the Republican House leadership, argued in an email that the collapse of the establishment began during the administration of George W. Bush:The establishment destroyed itself by blundering into the Iraq war and by not preventing the financial crisis of 2007. Those were the precipitating events that gave rise to the Tea Party which ultimately transformed into the Trump movement.“At a more granular level,” Feehery continued,the so-called influencers distanced themselves from the actual voters, retreating into a bubble and pontificating from their gated communities. This gave rise to the popularity of the conservative media movement, which became the go-to news source. The news from these sources didn’t have to be fully accurate as long as it seemed right.It cannot be emphasized enough how central the rise of information age right-wing media has been to the shifting balance of power within the Republican Party. In “Placing Media in Conservative Culture,” Matt Grossmann and David Hopkins, political scientists at Michigan State and Boston College, write that the growing strength of the ideological media “represents a mixed blessing from the perspective of Republican politicians and traditional conservative elites.”On the plus side, they write,Fox News, talk radio, and right-wing internet sites allow Republicans to communicate with their party’s popular base and help to mobilize conservative activists and voters against the Democratic opposition.On the negative side,the distinctive popular conservative culture that these media outlets both reinforce and promote is also fertile ground for repeated challenges to the party’s existing leadership by self-styled political outsiders — including, most notably, Donald Trump.The direct threat posed by conservative broadcast and digital media to the Republican establishment, according to Grossmann and Hopkins, is that figures like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity gain leverage not only by attacking the left, but “by accusing Republican politicians of ineffectiveness in opposing — if not outright complicity in — the enduring nemesis of liberalism.”Fox, Breitbart, Townhall, The Daily Caller and other right-wing media outlets now perform multiple functions traditionally associated with political parties: candidate screening, the maintenance of ideological conformity, reviewing policy positions and vetting congressional voting.The right-wing media was purposefully created by the conservative wing of the Republican Party, in part to help resolve a basic contradiction in the movement, according to Grossmann and Hopkins:Conservative candidates have also long grappled with the challenge of attracting electoral support for an ideological movement primarily dedicated to the perennially unpopular objective of limiting or rolling back major government programs and social benefits.Grossmann and Hopkins point out that a majority of American voters, when asked about specific policies, support federal spending. An April 2017 Pew Research Center survey, for example, found “that 61 percent of Republicans and 95 percent of Democrats would maintain or increase funding for health care” and that 61 percent of Republicans and 93 percent of Democrats “would maintain or increase spending for ‘economic assistance to needy people in the U.S.’ ”Crucial to the continued survival of the Republican Party, however, is the fact that when questions about taxes, spending and the role of government are put in generic, symbolic, abstract terms, without reference to specific policies, the majority of Americans take a conservative stance.How does this work? Substantially more voters identify themselves as conservative than as liberal, according to Gallup. Gallup also found that the public believes that the government wastes 51 cents of every dollar. In August 2017, Gallup reported that 52 percent of the public had an unfavorable view of the federal government and 29 percent had a favorable view.To counter potential defections to the Democratic Party, according to Grossmann and Hopkins, the right must focus on “conservatism as a brand name, or as a collection of general principles and values,” which is far more popular “than conservatism as a package of detailed policy positions.”Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, argued in an email that Trump and other Republican insurgents have been better at mobilizing their troops than the establishment wing of the party. The dissident wing, Lupia wrote, hasused social media to organize its myriad members more effectively. Some mass media outlets, and significant social media players, produce a steady stream of polarizing content that keeps members of the group hyper-vigilant towards real and imagined threats from globalists, foreigners, and the American left.Changes in campaign finance laws have acted in tandem with increasingly independent and influential conservative media outlets to undermine the Republican establishment. The most important of these changes came out of the 2010 Citizens United decision and related court rulings that opened the door to unlimited donations to super PACs, which effectively eliminated the near stranglehold vested Republican interests had on the flow of political money.This becomes glaringly apparent in a comparison of the pattern of fund-raising in 2008, the last election before the Citizens United decision, to the pattern in 2016. In the 2008 election, the three major Republican campaign committees raised a total of $657.6 million, six times the $111.9 million spent by nonparty conservative organizations.By 2016, however, the amount raised by the three Republican committees stagnated at $652.4 million, while the cash raised by conservative groups grew sevenfold to $810.4 million.In practical terms, the creation of a new and massive source of campaign support freed candidates to defy the establishment. This is just what the Tea Party did in 2010 and 2014.There is considerable disagreement over whether deregulated campaign finance and the mobilization of the angriest segment of the Republican electorate will inflict permanent damage on the Republican establishment.Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote me by email. “The establishment, such as it is, still exists, but its influence has been permanently weakened by changes in the media,” not just by conservative media, but by social media that “enables candidates to reach their respective bases in an inexpensive way. Endorsements and money mean less and less.”Ideological media outlets on both the left and right, Tanner argues “carry more weight than ever before,” displacing establishment influence over candidate selection, because both sides are now more dependent on mobilizing base voters than in persuading the ever-smaller faction of uncommitted voters.A colleague of Tanner’s, Emily Ekins, director of polling at Cato, argued in an email thatIt’s useful to not think of the G.O.P. establishment as a cohesive bloc but rather as a coalition that has been fracturing long before Trump arrived. We saw this with the rise of the tea party, the push to oust former Speaker John Boehner, the House Freedom Caucus, the inability of House Republicans to agree on health care reform, etc. Without cohesion it’s hard for it to control the process.Ekins points out that Trump’s successful defiance of the establishment in winning the nomination has not resulted in the abandonment of policies favored by the traditional power brokers.“When it comes to policymaking, traditional establishment priorities appear to maintain influence over agenda setting,” she wrote:Although reforming the tax system and repealing the ACA (Obamacare) are traditional Republican priorities, these were ranked far lower, below a border wall, among Trump’s core set of supporters. So while the establishment may be hanging back such that they avoid conflicts with Trump, they are still engaged in the policymaking process.Expanding on this theme in “Intraparty Democracy and the 2016 Election,” Julia Azari  and Seth Masket, political scientists at Marquette and the University of Denver, argue that the breakdown of establishment forces has endangered the workings of the political system. Democratization, in other words, has undermined democracy:It is not without irony that the most recent presidential election produced a result that so violated a great many substantive ideas about democracy. From his campaign promises to jail his opponent to his pre-election lamentations that the general electoral contests were rigged to his vows to strip citizens of their rights for expressing unpopular political views, Donald Trump proved to be one of the most hostile presidential candidates toward basic democratic norms in the modern age.How “did such democratic parties produce such an anti-democratic result?” Azari and Masket ask. Their answer:The parties’ moves toward internal party democracy, we maintain, helped create an environment in which a candidate like Trump could succeed. We believe that several aspects of party democratization are responsible for the inability of the Republican Party to thwart Trump’s candidacy.Put another way, the demotion of Republican power brokers opened the door to the Trump presidency.In a separate essay, “Weak parties and strong partisanship are a bad combination,” Azari wrote:Voters do not have to listen to elite signals. Elites do not have to listen to each other’s signals. Parties have been stripped (in part by their own actions) of their ability to coordinate and bargain.Not only have party establishments lost their ability to coordinate and bargain, but Trump has successfully pushed the Republican Party elite into a corner. As Masket wrote in an email,Trump has access to a group of voters that they’ve been courting for decades — working class whites. They’re eager to claim the support of this demographic and, more importantly, terrified to offend it by turning on Trump.The Trump insurgency, in this context, amounted to an internal realignment or revolution within the Republican Party. What is now the party’s largest bloc of voters — whites without college degrees — wrested power from the establishment.Data provided to The Times by Scott Keeter, a senior survey adviser at Pew Research Center, shows that these non-college white voters cast a solid majority — 62.7 percent — of all the votes Trump received in the 2016 election.A forthcoming study of Trump’s campaign speeches by three sociologists at Harvard — Michèle Lamont, Bo Yun Park and Elena Ayala-Hurtado — found that Trump purposely capitalized “on and appealed to workers’ desire to assert what they believe is their rightful place in the national pecking order,” including their premier status within the Republican Party.Henry Olsen, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, explained it this way in a January 2018 essay “Hearing the People” in National Review:Trump’s populism was simply the expression of one crucial but underrepresented element of the original conservative coalition, fighting back to achieve some measure of respect and equality.Sarah Treul, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, suggested in an email that by failing to take a firm stand against Trump in the early stages of the Republican primaries,the establishment may have lost its ability to be persuasive in future elections. The insurgence of inexperienced candidates will make it increasingly challenging for the establishment of either party to coordinate around one candidate even if it wants to.All this raises a larger question: Can the Republican Party continue to function over time without an elite establishment?Last week, in Politico, Alex Castellanos, the provocative Republican media consultant, made the intriguing argument that it is possible “to harness Trump’s base and add swing voters, even as we remain faithful to our principles.”As a first step, Castellanos calls for the renunciation of the traditional establishment, a group that converted the Reagan revolution from a movement into a business and then intoa self-preserving racket. In 2016, the American people judged that Washington Republicans had been poisoned by their success and become the very thing they were sent to the Capitol to change.In Castellanos’s view, the contemporary Republican Party must capitalize on Trump’s successes:He has crushed ISIS and increased our paychecks with a tax cut. He has erased regulations that were growing Washington’s economy at the expense of our economy. He has appointed a respected Supreme Court justice and transformed the judiciary to call balls and strikes.But the party must also steer clear of Trump’s failures:He left behind a vicious inflationary spiral. That, alongside devouring the country’s expectations for a president’s personal conduct, may be the greatest cost of his t. rex presidency.Permanently reorganizing the party around Trumpism will not be an easy task. Castellanos believes that Trump is likelyto be assessed as the bipolar leader he has become, both one of the worst and best presidents Americans have ever elected, perhaps the greatest president to be removed from the Oval Office in chains.Reflecting on the tumult, a Republican strategist who has been involved in campaigns at every level for more than 35 years and who is a dues-paying member of the establishment (and thus did not want his name used to avoid alienating his clients), expressed the contradictions of contemporary Republicanism with precision:The post-Trump world is a Humpty Dumpty story. No one is going to be able to put things back together again.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

business,"AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBy Eliza Sydnor RommMs. Romm is a descendent of a founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer.In the early 1880s, legend has it that Daniel B. Wesson, a co-founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer, heard about a child who injured himself by cocking the hammer and pulling the trigger of one of his firm’s revolvers. Wesson, known as D. B., was so distraught about the accident that he and his son, Joseph, developed a more child-safe revolver that they called the .38 Safety Hammerless.Wesson was also my great-great-great-grandfather. Though it has been half a century since my family was involved with Smith & Wesson, I feel a twinge of responsibility every time a mass shooting occurs. I realize this is not entirely rational: I play no part in making or selling firearms and have never lost anyone close to me from gun violence. But it still haunts me.After 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., I learned the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P 15, a version of an AR-15 military-style rifle. So I had to ask myself: What would D. B. Wesson have wanted his company to do? Would he have accepted the repeated refrain, “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people”?Obviously I cannot know what D. B. Wesson would want. But I would like to believe that he would have recoiled in horror and disbelief at the weapons created by the brand still bearing his name. And that he would have wanted all of us to ask more of his company today.It is only fair for me, for all of us, to demand that our gun manufacturers become leaders in this national discussion around gun violence. They create products designed to kill human beings. The responsibility that must accompany the creation of weapons like an AR-15 is too large to be brushed aside by shouting about freedom and an amendment to our Constitution ratified in 1791.Yes, the company and other gun makers have taken some steps in calling for better enforcement of the national background check system and sponsoring firearm safety programs. But they can do so much more.I would start by asking the parent company of Smith & Wesson, American Outdoor Brands Corporation, to push for gun-violence research. Since 1996 the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been severely restricted in researching gun violence. If gun manufacturers are truly responsible organizations, they should wholeheartedly want to back this research as a public health concern. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, asked Congress repeatedly to fund research in gun-violence prevention but never succeeded.In response to recent questions from BlackRock, an investment firm that owns the largest share of American Outdoor Brands, the gun maker’s president, James Debney, and chairman, Barry M. Monheit, said, “We must collectively have the courage to ensure any actions are guided by data, by facts and by what will actually make us safer.” Sounds like Mr. Debney, Mr. Monheit and Dr. Frieden are on the same page, so let’s see Smith & Wesson lead the charge in renewing gun-violence research by the C.D.C.I would also ask that the company publicly endorse the Brady Campaign’s Gun Dealer Code of Conduct. It should support requiring universal background checks and a national registry for tracking its products, and indeed all firearms. These measures would help prevent weapons from falling into the hands of the wrong people and make it easier for law enforcement to trace guns used in illegal activities. The refrain that criminals will always get their hands on a weapon, no matter what a gun manufacturer does, is apathetic and unacceptable. What will you do to make it better?Most obvious of all, Smith & Wesson should be pushing to require that all people who buy firearms undergo formal weapons training. Why would any responsible gun manufacturer not want a buyer trained extensively in how to properly use its very dangerous weapon?Do more than you are doing now. Have a purpose other than making money. Take part in this national discussion. Beyond expressions of sympathy, show the families of the victims of Parkland and Newtown and Columbine and Las Vegas and every nameless gun-violence tragedy occurring every day that you care about their pain and suffering.D. B. Wesson was a brilliant inventor who created a better gun than anyone had imagined in the 19th century. When he died in 1906, his guns had made him a multimillionaire. But he also cared deeply about the health and welfare of families and children. In his will, he left $450,000, the equivalent of more than $11 million in today’s money, for a hospital specializing in homeopathic medicine that was built a few years before he died and for the construction of another hospital to provide maternity care.If hearing about one child injured in the 1880s led him to invent the .38 Safety Hammerless, what would the more than 7,000 children killed or injured each year in the United States from gun violence stir in him? I believe if he could, he would beg the executives running Smith & Wesson today to stand up and join the fight to stop this bloodshed any way possible.Eliza Sydnor Romm, a distant relative of a co-founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer, is a small-business owner living in North Carolina.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

business,"AdvertisementWith Andrew Ross SorkinMARCH 7, 2018
Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching:• How foreign is Broadcom?• The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House.• The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs.• Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring.Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.As the Trump administration weighs whether to block the chip maker’s $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, a central issue is how much of a threat the deal is to national security. In an effort to assuage concerns, Broadcom pledged Wednesday to increase research spending on 5G wireless tech and to create a $1.5 billion fund to invest in training engineering talent in the United States to help allay those concerns.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer.AdvertisementBeyond Broadcom’s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let’s take a look at a number of factors.AdvertisementSalesFirst, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it: “China revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.”According to Broadcom’s most recent annual report, roughly 7 percent of its $17.6 billion in net revenue comes from the United States. The single biggest market for the company is China, which accounted for roughly 54 percent of its net revenue. “Other” markets made up nearly 38 percent.As a point of comparison, 2 percent of Qualcomm’s revenues come from the United States. Some 65 percent of its revenue comes from China, including Hong Kong, according to its most recent annual report.EmployeesRoughly 55 percent of Broadcom’s employees are based in North America, according to the annual report. About 38 percent are in Asia, and the remainder work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. About 52 percent of Qualcomm’s employees are based in the United States.Broadcom also said that about 62 percent of the square footage of its properties, both owned and leased, are in the United States. By contrast, Qualcomm has roughly 56 percent of its owned and leased facilities in the United States.Corporate governanceThe vast majority of Broadcom’s board are American citizens who live in the United States. That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years.Hock Tan, the company’s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990.Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore’s corporate rules.AdvertisementOwnershipThe two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard.— Michael de la MercedPresident Trump’s top economic adviser finally announced he would leave, in a sign that the nationalists have won the White House debate on tariffs.The news prompted Tom Nides, Morgan Stanley’s vice chairman, to utter aloud, “Oh, that’s a problem.”More on Mr. Cohn’s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday:It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.Potential replacements, according to Axios: Peter Navarro, the trade adviser who pushed for the tariffs; Kevin Warsh, the former Fed governor; Shahira Knight, a deputy of Mr. Cohn’s; and the pro-free-trade economist Larry Kudlow. But Axios says that there’s no official succession plan, and that other members of the National Economic Council will likely leave (We can rule out Austan Goolsbee.)The timing: CNBC notes that Mr. Cohn’s announcement came hours after Mr. Trump said that “everyone wants to work in the White House.” It also came after Mr. Trump tweeted, “There is no Chaos, only great Energy!”Peter Eavis’s take: Even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism.Critics’ corner: The WSJ editorial board said Mr. Cohn’s departure was “a significant blow” to Mr. Trump’s presidency. The NYT editorial board said Mr. Cohn had done “an awful job,” which still probably represented “the high-water mark for economic thinking” for this White House. And his former boss, Lloyd Blankfein, said he had served his country “in a first class way.”The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event – fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines — threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States?AdvertisementMaybe not.The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg.
            As fears of a trade war heat up, U.S. inflation expectations over the next five years have risen to the highest since 2013, as per 5-year forward breakeven contracts. pic.twitter.com/ZgXyYqxh6c One outcome: The concerns about a trade war may end up weighing on growth and causing the inflationary pressures to abate. That would give the Fed more room to maneuver, perhaps allowing it to raise interest rates more slowly.But it could get messy. Trade tariffs, applied broadly, could push up the prices of many goods at a time when the Fed has to grapple with the enormous fiscal stimulus that Congress just enacted.- Peter EavisFederal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed’s target of 2 percent this year.“Mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.”What are those tailwinds?“The most notable tailwind is the shift in America’s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.”Ms. Brainard’s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy.Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke.Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here’s a look at some reactions:Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote: “The resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.”Brian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote: “Regardless of whether Mr. Cohn’s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump’s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the “adult in the room” in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.”What does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta.Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote: “It still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump’s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.”But he adds:“It does “pull forward” risk of the “Bad Trump” scenario which that market had largely “priced-out” into the “now.”Between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, the billionaire investor sold about $31 million of the crane maker's stock.AdvertisementTo some, that seemed like good timing.Since the day before he started selling, the stock is down 20 percent. The catalyst? The Trump administration’s plans to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Manitowoc stock fell 4.8 percent on Feb. 16 when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross unveiled a report calling for tariffs on imported steel. The company’s shares then dropped 6 percent Thursday when President Trump announced his plan.On Wednesday, Mr. Icahn said he had no knowledge of the Trump administration’s plans when he moved to reduce his holding. In a statement on his website, Mr. Icahn said:“We don’t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration’s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.”The political bloc formally announced its plan to counterattack, including taxing American goods like Harley-Davidsons and bourbon and filing a challenge with the World Trade Organization.Meanwhile, allies continued to fret. South Korea worries that tariffs will complicate its efforts to denuclearize the North. Christine Lagarde of the I.M.F. warned of the perils of a trade war. And fellow Republicans in Washington continued to lobby the White House.The aluminum industry doesn’t want tariffs eitherIn a letter to the White House yesterday, the Aluminum Association (which represents both U.S. and foreign suppliers) said that the move would be a bad idea.Complaints can be heard around the sector. The C.E.O. of Novelis, a big aluminum producer, criticized Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for saying predictions of price increases were “hysteria.” And DowDuPont said it might now build plants in Canada or Argentina rather than the U.S.Bayer said it is in exclusive talks with BASF about the sale of its entire vegetable seeds business as the German chemicals multinational, seeks to win approval for its $56 billion deal for Monsanto from European regulators.European antitrust regulators opened an in-depth investigation into Bayer’s planned acquisition of Monsanto, its American agribusiness rival, in August. European competition authorities are expected to wrap up their inquiry by early next month.The proposed combination is the latest in a series of mergers in the rapidly consolidating seed and agrochemical sector.AdvertisementBayer previously agreed to sell selected businesses with its Crop Sciences unit to BASF for 5.9 billion euros, or about $7.3 billion at current exchange rates, in October. Both deals, if one were to be reached on the vegetable seeds business, would be subject to the Monsanto transaction closing.— Chad BrayMr. Rosenberg had a long career in government: twice U.S. attorney, he’s been a longtime senior official at the Justice Department (including as chief of staff to James Comey) and acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Its “private equity” cost-cutting could lead to Qualcomm reducing investment in R. & D. and ceding its 5G lead to Huawei of China, according to the letter.Broadcom said this morning that it was committed to advancing 5G and that it is an American company in everything but legal headquarters.More on Huawei: It’s the Chinese tech company that Washington fears the most, even if other companies don’t.Another take, from DealBook’s friend Steven Davidoff Solomon:The onetime king of messaging devices has accused Facebook of violating its patents in Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.More from Ahmed Farhatha of Reuters:Litigation over patent infringement is part of BlackBerry chief executive John Chen’s strategy for making money for the company, which has lost market share in the smartphone market it once dominated.Facebook says that it will fight the lawsuit and added, “BlackBerry’s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business.”Today in virtual currencies: Coinbase is creating an index fund including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether and Litecoin.

business,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.We may never stop arguing about which historic currents swept President Trump into the White House.Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum, is unlikely to have had Trump in mind when he described the fourth industrial revolution in Davos in January 2016:We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued,the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.First Schwab looked at the bright side:The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many “workers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,” he said, and the “middle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.”We tend to think of immigration — now fracturing parties of the left and right both here and in Europe — as distinct from technological innovation, but the two issues are intertwined on many levels, even down to the fact that most unauthorized immigrants are people who fly here and overstay their visas, not those who cross rural borders on foot. And air travel is the least of it.In an August 2015 Times story, “A 21st-Century Migrant’s Essentials: Food, Shelter, Smartphone,” Matthew Brunwasser described the situation that obtains now:In this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends.Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, “Patterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century”:The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier.There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative.“The IT revolution improved living standards and its great technical achievements enjoy a high level of consumer and political support,” Mordecai Kurz, an economist at Stanford, wrote in a June 2017 paper. “However these sources of social benefits are also the cause of social losses and rising inequality that threaten the foundation of democratic society.”Schwab, a year earlier, had put it this way: There is an “inexorable shift from simple digitization (the Third Industrial Revolution) to innovation based on combinations of technologies (the Fourth Industrial Revolution).”With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences:As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor.Just to give a sense of the exponential nature of the rate of technological change, here’s how Sergey Brin described it in this year’s “Founders’ Letter,” which was released earlier this week:The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations — a factor of about 200,000 difference — and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.In point of fact, the use of robots — and of other methods of replacing workers with machines — has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe.According to the International Federation of Robotics, “By regions, the average robot density per 10,000 employees in Europe is 99 units, in the Americas 84 and in Asia 63 units.”In a March 2018 paper, “We Were The Robots: Automation in Manufacturing and Voting Behavior in Western Europe,” Massimo Anelli, Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig, of Bocconi University in Milan, found that “robot shock increases support for nationalist and radical right parties.”The authors note that “both technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.”“Job losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email:In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs.Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University — Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen — was crucial to Trump’s victory.In their October 2017 paper, “Political Machinery: Did Robots Swing the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election?” the authors demonstrate thatSupport for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper:AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (‘mid-skilled’) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services.In his paper, “Computers and Populism: Artificial Intelligence, Jobs and Politics in the Near Term,” Levy writes:On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization’s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs.Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, “there should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities” by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects.Surveying the trucking industry recently in “The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation,” Darrell West, a scholar at Brookings, warns that full adoption of driverless vehicles “would put at least 2.5 million drivers out of work.”Assessing the full range of employment, West observes thatRobots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs.Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace,the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case.Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy’s answer is: farther down the ladder:AI’s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage workinto such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services.For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women’s and reproductive rights movements.)Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers:Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill.Levy writes:A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the ""people” and the “elite” based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal “elites” who make a very good living developing robots to put “the people” out of work.While Levy looks at the issue from the vantage point of those harmed by A.I., robotics and information technology, Kurz, the Stanford economist, examines the economic winners. In a recent essay for Project Syndicate, he writes:IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial.The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks thedark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth.While operating legally — indeed with the full support of the legal system — contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz:Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors — additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs — then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms.According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences:Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion — equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income — in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points.The result is a cascading effect causedboth by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular.Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, pointed out in a December 2017 paper, “Should We Be Reassured If Automation in the Future Looks Like Automation in the Past?” thatThe history of automation — and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades — suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation.Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs:The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience.Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in “the process of turnover,” which “could lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.” In the short run,not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this “short run” could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of “short runs” for even longer.A short run that lasts for decades — or a series of short runs that last even longer — would seem to warrant grave alarm.While much of the focus on job losses resulting from robotization and trade has been on men, a January 2018 study led by Saadia Zahidi, head of Education, Gender and Work, at the World Economic Forum, found that “among the workers affected by labor market disruptions, under both models, a larger share — 57 percent — are projected to be female.”A separate study of the potential consequences of automation in England, “Managing automation: Employment, inequality and ethics in the digital age,” written by Carys Roberts, Mathew Lawrence and Loren King, researchers at the Institute for Public Policy Research, found thatOf all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology.Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade.Furman lists some initiatives:expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice.Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income.These proposals — some underwhelming or undoable — find strong support among Democratic elected officials.Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant — not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans.Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect.Expanding on Autor’s work, Andrea Cerrato and Francesco Ruggieri, of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and Federico Maria Ferrara, of the University of Geneva, wrote in their March 2018 paper, “Why Does Import Competition Favor Republicans? Localized Trade Shocks, Voting Behavior, and Scapegoating in the U.S.”:Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups.The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants “takes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.”In other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well.In highly polarized times, when partisans view victory by the opposition as a threat to the nation, Republicans will easily find ways to rationalize continued economic deterioration and the ongoing demonization of immigrants and minorities. They’ve had a lot of practice and they have effectively boxed themselves into a scapegoat strategy that capitalizes on — instead of improving — the suffering of many of their most loyal supporters.The hard core of Trump’s voters — more than half of all Republican voters don’t just approve of him, but strongly approve — have, in turn, demonstrated a willingness to deify the president no matter what he does or says — a deification dependent in no small part on Trump’s adoption of new communications technologies like Twitter.The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval — and the success of this strategy to date — suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics — if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

business,"AdvertisementWith Andrew Ross SorkinMARCH 29, 2018
Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching:• Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon.• Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook’s board.• Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.• Another FANG stock took a tumble.• The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments.The DealBook newsletter is taking a break for Good Friday. We’ll be back with you on Monday. Sign up for it here.
            I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!        Amazon hasn’t responded to President Trump’s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won’t.AdvertisementMr. Trump’s criticisms, though, are largely mistaken. For a long time, Amazon did not pay state sales tax, but it does so now when it sells its own goods in states that collect it. It is the case, however, that in most states Amazon does not collect sales taxes on goods sold by third parties through its platform. As for the United States Postal Service, Amazon’s business appears to be giving a welcome lift to its package shipping revenue.AdvertisementStill, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon’s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States, a recent survey estimated. Its revenue is a third of Walmart’s and, even after its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon’s footing in the grocery business is still small.All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.Amazon also has a loyal customer base — it has an estimated 90 million Prime members — and the public views it relatively favorably. When the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public.Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That’s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.— Peter EavisThe investment adviser to New York City’s pension funds is calling for changes to Facebook’s board to address the fallout from Cambridge Analytica’s improper harvesting of information from 50 million users of the social network.AdvertisementNew York City’s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:“Facebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company’s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.”New York City’s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook’s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook’s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.Here are the proposed changes:1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board’s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company’s data privacy policies and risks.4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can “recoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.”President Trump spoke out against Amazon on Thursday, saying that the online behemoth does not pay enough taxes and uses the United States postal system “as their Delivery Boy.”
            I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!        The president’s commentary, made in a Twitter post, comes amid reports that Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in reining in the e-commerce business.AdvertisementAmazon and the company’s founder, Jeff Bezos, are among Mr. Trump’s regular Twitter targets. In December, Mr. Trump questioned whether the United States Post Office charges Amazon enough for package deliveries. And in August, Mr. Trump said Amazon hurts taxpaying businesses.Amazon, however, does pay taxes — $412 million in 2016, for instance, according to the company’s report to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws.“Trump’s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.”Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes. But the administration is always looking at its options, the official added. The stock closed down 4.4 percent Wednesday.Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.Should shareholders worry? The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon’s business model, but it was still “the last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today.”Retailers, at least, already have some reason to be cheerful.And Amazon has another target market for expansion: housekeeping.Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.AdvertisementPerhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch’s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.Concerns about Tesla’s ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt.The WSJ’s Charley Grant explains:Tesla can’t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts:After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay $2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages.AdvertisementThe Justice Department sued the bank in December 2016 after the two sides failed to reach a settlement despite months of talks. The settlement is the latest by a European lender related to residential mortgage-backed securities sold ahead of the financial crisis and follows agreements reached by Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank in late 2016.“I am pleased that we have been able to reach a fair and proportionate settlement with the Department of Justice,” James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, said in a news release. “It has been a priority for this management team from the start to resolve these historic issues in a timely and appropriate manner wherever possible.”Two former Barclays executives who were sued along with the bank also have reached settlements, agreeing to pay a combined $2 million, the Justice Department said in a news release.Their lawyers separately said the government’s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.- Chad BrayTammy Kiely is leaving Goldman Sachs to join Morgan Stanley as global head of semiconductor and auto technology investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.Ms. Kiely, who will be based in Menlo Park, Calif., joined Goldman in 1999 and had headed its semiconductor investment banking team since 2006, becoming a partner in 2014.

technology,"AdvertisementBy REUTERSMAY 3, 2018, 10:31 A.M. E.D.T.
SAN FRANCISCO —  Ducking analysts' questions has a price: $2 billion.Tesla Inc investors gave a rare rebuke to iconoclastic Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday after he cut off analysts asking about profit potential, sending shares down 5 percent despite promises that production of the troubled Model 3 electric car was on track.Tesla's future depends on the Model 3 and the company said that it had largely overcome production bottlenecks, with Musk vowing a dramatic turnaround that would reverse losses and generate positive cash flow in just a few months.Musk plans to shut down its Fremont, California factory for 10 days in the second quarter but said Tesla will meet the production target of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June, as planned, and will turn a profit in the second half of the year.To achieve profitability, Musk will have to reverse what today amounts to a $22,584 pre-tax loss per vehicle built by the Silicon Valley company. Tesla posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss when it announced first-quarter results on Wednesday.AdvertisementTesla stock was little changed after the earnings announcement but fell during a conference call, when Musk began cutting analysts' questions short, costing Tesla over $2 billion in market capitalization.Advertisement""These questions are so dry. They're killing me,"" Musk said after an analyst asked what percentage of Tesla 3 reservation holders have started to configure options for their cars, an indicator of how much profit Tesla will be able to wring from the vehicles. Another analyst asked about a capital requirement before being cut off.He then took several questions in a row about plans for a self-driving car network and other long-term projects from the host of a YouTube channel focused on investing, praising the questions as not boring.5,000 MODEL 3s PER WEEKMusk's ability to run Tesla is crucial as the company strives to efficiently and profitably build its first vehicle intended to be produced at high volume, the Model 3.Musk acknowledged error recently in over-automating the Model 3 assembly-line, which has resulted in production delays, but it is still unclear how long and costly it will be to unwind this mistake.Delayed Model 3 production also comes as a slew of competitors bring new electric vehicle models to market.The company stood by a previously announced target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June.Tesla's capital expenditures declined in the quarter and the company cut its spending forecasts for 2018, saying it would spend less than $3 billion. Tesla spent $3.4 billion in 2017. (https://bit.ly/2jn15SB)AdvertisementInvesting.com analyst Clement Thibault said the reduction was noteworthy, ""but in the long run given challenges that lay ahead of Tesla, I don't think it is going to make or break the company.""Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Analysts had not expected so much spending, predicting hundreds of millions of dollars less in so-called cash burn, according to Thomson Reuters data.Tesla did not break out a cash flow calculation that it had included in previous quarters.The niche carmaker, which two years ago vowed to build 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018, has attracted legions of fans for its advanced technology and design. But the company rushed its Model 3 to market, making mistakes in manufacturing whose effects are now being felt, and investor skepticism has risen.Questions over Tesla's finances are top of mind, and many analysts anticipate a capital raise in 2018 despite Musk's statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters.Tesla said gross margins on the Model 3, which today are slightly negative, would be close to flat in the second quarter and grow to ""highly positive"" in the second half of the year.Tesla said it produced 2,270 Model 3s per week in the last week of April. It said net reservations for the Model 3, including configured orders not yet delivered, exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.Automotive revenue rose only 1 percent from the prior quarter to $2.74 billion.RECORD LOSSTesla reported a record loss of $709.6 million, or $4.19 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $330.3 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, Tesla had a loss of $3.35 per share. Analysts had expected a loss of $3.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said it ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash after spending $655.7 million in quarterly capital expenses.AdvertisementThe lack of Model 3 revenue has exacerbated Tesla's cash burn as the company continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on multiple projects in the pipeline, such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory.The Model Y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for Tesla, which also launched a Tesla Semi and a new Roadster in recent months.(This version corrects Model 3 production target  In paragraph 4, to 5,000/week, not per day)(Reporting by Alexandria Sage in San Francisco and Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson, Matthew Lewis and Lisa Shumaker)We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas B. EdsallMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.We may never stop arguing about which historic currents swept President Trump into the White House.Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum, is unlikely to have had Trump in mind when he described the fourth industrial revolution in Davos in January 2016:We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued,the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.First Schwab looked at the bright side:The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many “workers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,” he said, and the “middle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.”We tend to think of immigration — now fracturing parties of the left and right both here and in Europe — as distinct from technological innovation, but the two issues are intertwined on many levels, even down to the fact that most unauthorized immigrants are people who fly here and overstay their visas, not those who cross rural borders on foot. And air travel is the least of it.In an August 2015 Times story, “A 21st-Century Migrant’s Essentials: Food, Shelter, Smartphone,” Matthew Brunwasser described the situation that obtains now:In this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends.Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, “Patterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century”:The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier.There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative.“The IT revolution improved living standards and its great technical achievements enjoy a high level of consumer and political support,” Mordecai Kurz, an economist at Stanford, wrote in a June 2017 paper. “However these sources of social benefits are also the cause of social losses and rising inequality that threaten the foundation of democratic society.”Schwab, a year earlier, had put it this way: There is an “inexorable shift from simple digitization (the Third Industrial Revolution) to innovation based on combinations of technologies (the Fourth Industrial Revolution).”With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences:As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor.Just to give a sense of the exponential nature of the rate of technological change, here’s how Sergey Brin described it in this year’s “Founders’ Letter,” which was released earlier this week:The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations — a factor of about 200,000 difference — and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.In point of fact, the use of robots — and of other methods of replacing workers with machines — has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe.According to the International Federation of Robotics, “By regions, the average robot density per 10,000 employees in Europe is 99 units, in the Americas 84 and in Asia 63 units.”In a March 2018 paper, “We Were The Robots: Automation in Manufacturing and Voting Behavior in Western Europe,” Massimo Anelli, Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig, of Bocconi University in Milan, found that “robot shock increases support for nationalist and radical right parties.”The authors note that “both technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.”“Job losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email:In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs.Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University — Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen — was crucial to Trump’s victory.In their October 2017 paper, “Political Machinery: Did Robots Swing the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election?” the authors demonstrate thatSupport for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper:AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (‘mid-skilled’) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services.In his paper, “Computers and Populism: Artificial Intelligence, Jobs and Politics in the Near Term,” Levy writes:On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization’s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs.Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, “there should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities” by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects.Surveying the trucking industry recently in “The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation,” Darrell West, a scholar at Brookings, warns that full adoption of driverless vehicles “would put at least 2.5 million drivers out of work.”Assessing the full range of employment, West observes thatRobots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs.Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace,the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case.Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy’s answer is: farther down the ladder:AI’s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage workinto such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services.For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women’s and reproductive rights movements.)Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers:Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill.Levy writes:A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the ""people” and the “elite” based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal “elites” who make a very good living developing robots to put “the people” out of work.While Levy looks at the issue from the vantage point of those harmed by A.I., robotics and information technology, Kurz, the Stanford economist, examines the economic winners. In a recent essay for Project Syndicate, he writes:IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial.The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks thedark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth.While operating legally — indeed with the full support of the legal system — contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz:Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors — additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs — then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms.According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences:Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion — equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income — in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points.The result is a cascading effect causedboth by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular.Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, pointed out in a December 2017 paper, “Should We Be Reassured If Automation in the Future Looks Like Automation in the Past?” thatThe history of automation — and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades — suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation.Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs:The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience.Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in “the process of turnover,” which “could lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.” In the short run,not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this “short run” could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of “short runs” for even longer.A short run that lasts for decades — or a series of short runs that last even longer — would seem to warrant grave alarm.While much of the focus on job losses resulting from robotization and trade has been on men, a January 2018 study led by Saadia Zahidi, head of Education, Gender and Work, at the World Economic Forum, found that “among the workers affected by labor market disruptions, under both models, a larger share — 57 percent — are projected to be female.”A separate study of the potential consequences of automation in England, “Managing automation: Employment, inequality and ethics in the digital age,” written by Carys Roberts, Mathew Lawrence and Loren King, researchers at the Institute for Public Policy Research, found thatOf all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology.Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade.Furman lists some initiatives:expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice.Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income.These proposals — some underwhelming or undoable — find strong support among Democratic elected officials.Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant — not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans.Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect.Expanding on Autor’s work, Andrea Cerrato and Francesco Ruggieri, of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and Federico Maria Ferrara, of the University of Geneva, wrote in their March 2018 paper, “Why Does Import Competition Favor Republicans? Localized Trade Shocks, Voting Behavior, and Scapegoating in the U.S.”:Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups.The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants “takes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.”In other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well.In highly polarized times, when partisans view victory by the opposition as a threat to the nation, Republicans will easily find ways to rationalize continued economic deterioration and the ongoing demonization of immigrants and minorities. They’ve had a lot of practice and they have effectively boxed themselves into a scapegoat strategy that capitalizes on — instead of improving — the suffering of many of their most loyal supporters.The hard core of Trump’s voters — more than half of all Republican voters don’t just approve of him, but strongly approve — have, in turn, demonstrated a willingness to deify the president no matter what he does or says — a deification dependent in no small part on Trump’s adoption of new communications technologies like Twitter.The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval — and the success of this strategy to date — suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics — if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Jack Ewing and Carlos TejadaFRANKFURT — Stocks in the United States were up slightly Tuesday morning after a tough day on Wall Street had sent the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index down more than 10 percent from its recent peak.Major global indexes followed Wall Street’s cue, trading mostly down on Tuesday, though they were largely spared Monday’s pain. European stocks were down less than 1 percent in midafternoon trading, and stocks in Asia finished the day mixed.Investors around the world have recently been reacting to the same set of uncertainties, including growing concern over the prospect of a full-blown trade war between the United States and China.The recent downswing came on the heels of an extended period of calm in the markets. They have risen over the past couple of years as the economies of the United States, Europe and China appeared to be humming along together at a healthy clip for the first time in years.And the markets are still up more than 20 percent since November 2016, when Donald J. Trump won the presidency — a roller-coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what his administration could bring to Washington.But after such a long run-up, many investors have naturally begun to wonder how much longer the good times will last.“We think the time has come to reassess the one-way bet on a continued and strengthening global economic expansion,” Carl B. Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y., said in a note to clients on Tuesday.Monday’s slump in the United States, however, had another driver that world markets did not: big-name technology companies.Amazon, Facebook, Intel, Microsoft and Tesla were among the major contributors to Monday’s stock slump on Wall Street. Amazon faces pressure from President Trump, while Facebook continues to grapple with privacy concerns and Tesla has been hit by a succession of negative headlines.Tech shares were among the worst performers in other markets too, like China, Hong Kong and Japan, though the world’s biggest technology companies primarily trade in the United States — in part to reach global investors.. Shares of Alibaba, a Chinese online retailer, joined the American tech rout on Monday, falling more than 3 percent, while shares of the Chinese search company Baidu fell more than 1 percent.The woes of tech companies may even be positive for some European companies. Tesla’s battery powered cars and self-driving technology were a threat to European luxury carmakers like BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen’s Audi unit, which remain heavily invested in internal combustion engines.But Tesla has had trouble ramping up production fast enough to meet demand, and its vehicles have suffered quality problems. On Tuesday, the company reported a significant increase in the production of its Model 3 sedans in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the previous quarter, though it failed to meet previously announced production targets. The company’s difficulties have added credence to the argument that German carmakers have made all along: Mass producing cars is hard, and it will not be easy for new challengers to match the expertise of traditional carmakers.Still, shares of German carmakers were mixed in European trading on Tuesday, as the likes of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen depend heavily on sales in Asia and would suffer from any economic turmoil there.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Carlos Tejada from Hong Kong.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

To the government, it’s more like “big brother,” a term of endearment used by many Indians to address a stranger when asking for help.For other countries, the technology could provide a model for how to track their residents. And for India’s top court, the ID system presents unique legal issues that will define what the constitutional right to privacy means in the digital age.To Adita Jha, Aadhaar was simply a hassle. The 30-year-old environmental consultant in Delhi waited in line three times to sit in front of a computer that photographed her face, captured her fingerprints and snapped images of her irises. Three times, the data failed to upload. The fourth attempt finally worked, and she has now been added to the 1.1 billion Indians already included in the program.Ms. Jha had little choice but to keep at it. The government has made registration mandatory for hundreds of public services and many private ones, from taking school exams to opening bank accounts.“You almost feel like life is going to stop without an Aadhaar,” Ms. Jha said.Technology has given governments around the world new tools to monitor their citizens. In China, the government is rolling out ways to use facial recognition and big data to track people, aiming to inject itself further into everyday life. Many countries, including Britain, deploy closed-circuit cameras to monitor their populations.But India’s program is in a league of its own, both in the mass collection of biometric data and in the attempt to link it to everything — traffic tickets, bank accounts, pensions, even meals for undernourished schoolchildren.“No one has approached that scale and that ambition,” said Jacqueline Bhabha, a professor and research director of Harvard’s FXB Center for Health and Human Rights, who has studied biometric ID systems around the world. “It has been hailed, and justifiably so, as an extraordinary triumph to get everyone registered.”Critics fear that the government will gain unprecedented insight into the lives of all Indians.In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other champions of the program say that Aadhaar is India’s ticket to the future, a universal, easy-to-use ID that will reduce this country’s endemic corruption and help bring even the most illiterate into the digital age.“It’s the equivalent of building interstate highways,” said Nandan Nilekani, the technology billionaire who was tapped by the government in 2009 to build the Aadhaar system. “If the government invested in building a digital public utility and that is made available as a platform, then you actually can create major innovations around that.”The potential uses — from surveillance to managing government benefit programs — have drawn interest elsewhere. Sri Lanka is planning a similar system, and Britain, Russia and the Philippines are studying it, according to the Indian government.Aadhaar, which means “foundation” in English, was initially intended as a difficult-to-forge ID to reduce fraud and improve the delivery of government welfare programs.But Mr. Modi, who has promoted a “digital India” vision since his party took power in 2014, has vastly expanded its ambitions.The poor must scan their fingerprints at the ration shop to get their government allocations of rice. Retirees must do the same to get their pensions. Middle-school students cannot enter the water department’s annual painting contest until they submit their identification.In some cities, newborns cannot leave the hospital until their parents sign them up. Even leprosy patients, whose illness damages their fingers and eyes, have been told they must pass fingerprint or iris scans to get their benefits.The Modi government has also ordered Indians to link their IDs to their cellphone and bank accounts. States have added their own twists, like using the data to map where people live. Some employers use the ID for background checks on job applicants.“Aadhaar has added great strength to India’s development,” Mr. Modi said in a January speech to military cadets. Officials estimate that taxpayers have saved at least $9.4 billion from Aadhaar by weeding out “ghosts” and other improper beneficiaries of government services.Opponents have filed at least 30 cases against the program in India’s Supreme Court. They argue that Aadhaar violates India’s Constitution — and, in particular, a unanimous court decision last year that declared for the first time that Indians had a fundamental right to privacy.Rahul Narayan, one of the lawyers challenging the system, said the government was essentially building one giant database on its citizens. “There has been a sort of mission creep to it all along,” he said.The court has been holding extensive hearings and is expected to make a ruling in the spring.The government argues that the universal ID is vital in a country where hundreds of millions of people do not have widely accepted identification documents.“The people themselves are the biggest beneficiaries,” said Ajay B. Pandey, the Minnesota-trained engineer who leads the Unique Identification Authority of India, the government agency that oversees the system. “This identity cannot be refused.”Businesses are also using the technology to streamline transactions.Banks once sent employees to the homes of account applicants to verify their addresses. Now, accounts can be opened online and finished with a fingerprint scan at a branch or other authorized outlet. Reliance Jio, a telecom provider, relies on an Aadhaar fingerprint scan to conduct the government-mandated ID check for purchases of cellphone SIM cards. That allows clerks to activate service immediately instead of forcing buyers to wait a day or two.But the Aadhar system has also raised practical and legal issues.Although the system’s core fingerprint, iris and face database appears to have remained secure, at least 210 government websites have leaked other personal data — such as name, birth date, address, parents’ names, bank account number and Aadhaar number — for millions of Indians. Some of that data is still available with a simple Google search.As Aadhaar has become mandatory for government benefits, parts of rural India have struggled with the internet connections necessary to make Aadhaar work. After a lifetime of manual labor, many Indians also have no readable prints, making authentication difficult. One recent study found that 20 percent of the households in Jharkand state had failed to get their food rations under Aadhaar-based verification — five times the failure rate of ration cards.“This is the population that is being passed off as ghosts and bogus by the government,” said Reetika Khera, an associate professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, who co-wrote the study.Seeing these problems, some local governments have scaled back the use of Aadhaar for public benefits. In February, the government for the Delhi region announced that it would stop using Aadhaar to deliver food benefits.Dr. Pandey said that some problems were inevitable but that his agency was trying to fix them. The government is patching security holes and recently added face recognition as an alternative to fingerprint or iris scans to make it easier to verify identities.Fears that the Indian government could use Aadhaar to turn the country into a surveillance state, he said, are overblown. “There is no central authority that has all the information,” he said.Before Aadhaar, he said, hundreds of millions of Indians could not easily prove who they were.“If you are not able to prove your identity, you are disenfranchised,” he said. “You have no existence.”Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter: @vindugoel.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Nick Wingfield and Jack NicasFor more than a decade, some of the best known technology companies, including Google, Facebook and Snap, have sold shares to the public while maintaining a corporate structure that allowed their founders to keep tight control over their companies.For Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, it was a way to protect themselves from pesky investors interested in short-term gains, even as shareholder advocates blasted the arrangements for creating unaccountable leaders.Now Zynga, a once high-flying maker of popular internet games such as FarmVille and Words With Friends, has taken the unusual step of scrapping its founder-friendly structure — a change that could make it easier for the company to sell itself down the line.The founder-empowered structure at the heart of many tech companies is known as a multiclass stock structure, under which those who started the company own a certain class of stock that gives them outsize voting power even after it goes public.At Zynga, Mark Pincus, the company’s founder, has now converted some of his shares that carry more voting clout — known as Class B and C shares — into common Class A shares. The conversion reduces his overall voting power at Zynga to about 10 percent from about 70 percent. Mr. Pincus will not see any change in his economic interest in the company from the conversion.The change comes as Mr. Pincus and his wife, Alison Gelb Pincus, are going through a divorce. Last year, publications in San Francisco, where Zynga is based, speculated that the divorce could jeopardize his control over Zynga. Ms. Pincus is challenging a prenuptial agreement with her husband, according to a document filed in California Superior Court. An attorney for Ms. Pincus did not respond to a request for comment.In a phone interview, Mr. Pincus said his divorce, which he described as amicable, was “not part of or relevant to the announcement” of his conversion of his stock.Rather, Mr. Pincus said, he made the decision in consultation with Zynga’s board, partly because of growing criticism of dual- and multiclass share structures. As part of the change, Mr. Pincus said, he will leave Zynga as an employee — he was executive chairman — and become nonexecutive chairman of the company’s board of directors.“We think the company doesn’t benefit anymore from a multiclass structure,” Mr. Pincus said.Dual-class voting structures have been around for decades and have been especially popular at media companies, such as News Corporation and The New York Times Company.Many prominent tech companies have turned to them as well, starting with the initial public offering of Google in 2004. Since then, Facebook, Zynga, Snap and a variety of others have followed suit with similar structures. As a result, shareholder meetings for some of the world’s most valuable companies — including Facebook and Alphabet, the holding company that now owns Google — are mostly for show. Shareholders propose and vote on resolutions even though the founders have the only votes that matter.The vast majority of companies that go public have a single class of stock, where one share equals one vote. About 81 percent of companies that went public last year had single-class arrangements, according to the Council of Institutional Investors, a nonprofit association of pension funds and other large investors.Charles Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware, said that in his 20 years of tracking issues around multiclass stock structures, Mr. Pincus was the first public company executive he could recall who voluntarily reduced his voting power so dramatically.“It’s quite an unusual move, but it’s a welcome move,” Mr. Elson said.Multiclass structures are bad for ordinary investors because they make founders unaccountable, he added. “If a C.E.O. does a poor job, he’s not going to fire himself,” he said. “The problems it creates far outweigh any benefits.”Some recent studies, however, have suggested that companies with multiclass structures have outperformed companies with a single stock class. A report last month by the lawyer David Berger and Prof. Laurie Simon Hodrick of Columbia Business School concluded that there are benefits to multiclass structures, including limiting pressure from institutional investors, which own the majority of public shares. The authors said that calls to limit multiclass structures were premature.In response to some of the criticism of multiclass structures, more companies are going public with provisions that automatically convert their shares to a single class after a period of time, anywhere from five to 20 years. Fitbit, the maker of fitness trackers, went public in 2015 with a 12-year provision that sunsets its dual-class stock, while the cloud software company Okta went public last year with a similar 10-year provision.Mr. Pincus said Zynga’s multiclass share structure provided his company with “air cover” during several difficult years after it went public at the end of 2011. The company originally made games that people played on Facebook through desktop web browsers, but its business was upended by the surge of mobile gaming on smartphones.Zynga gradually focused on mobile games, but its stock has languished even as it has mounted a turnaround under a new chief executive, Frank Gibeau. The company’s shares closed at $3.64 on Wednesday, far below the $10 public offering price. Zynga also announced it had swung to a profit of $5.6 million in the first quarter from a loss of $9.5 million a year ago.Mr. Pincus said his voting control at Zynga had not given him veto power over outside offers to acquire the company, though it did give him the ability to replace board members. He said he had never exercised that right.When asked if Zynga could consider acquisition offers more easily now that Mr. Pincus had relinquished most of his voting power, Mr. Gibeau said, “That’s not our mission — our focus is to grow the company.”Mr. Pincus said he intended to devote more time to investing in start-ups. He said he was particularly interested in companies focused on the blockchain, the technology that’s behind electronic currencies like Bitcoin, but could also have broader applications.Giving up his control of Zynga, Mr. Pincus said, will “create more space between me and the company whenever I go launch new products.”Follow Nick Wingfield and Jack Nicas on Twitter: @nickwingfield and @jacknicas.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

 JENNIFER SZALAI
 
MARCH 7, 2018
The current president may be completely uninterested in cultivating a number of traditional political skills — among them a sense of discretion and at least the semblance of self-control — but he has an uncanny feel for political symbolism, especially when it comes to the role of manufacturing in the United States. Factory work provides a diminishing share of working-class jobs: There were 43,000 iron and steelworkers last year, compared with almost 2 million hospital and home health aides. But to hear President Trump tell it, the factory workers are the ones who matter most. Just last week, he declared steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, tweeting that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.”Joshua B. Freeman’s rich and ambitious “Behemoth: A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern World” depicts a world in retreat that still looms large in the national imagination. “Behemoth” is more than an economic history, or a chronicle of architectural feats and labor movements. Freeman, a professor at Queens College and the Graduate Center of CUNY, traces the rise of the factory and how it became entwined with Enlightenment ideas of progress — “the notion that through human effort and rationality the world could be transformed toward greater abundance, well-being and moral order.”Factories weren’t always imbued with such lofty ideals. They were initially devised “to take advantage of mundane commercial opportunities,” Freeman writes. He dates the first factory to 1721: a silk mill, built in Derby, England. In the decade after it opened, Daniel Defoe paid it a visit, declaring it “a Curiosity of a very extraordinary Nature.”The proliferation of these curiosities, culminating in the Industrial Revolution, took some time. Obtaining machinery and technical know-how often entailed some trade espionage, before the British government took an active hand in promoting industrial development.AdvertisementLabor discipline was another matter. In the farming and domestic work that people had been doing for generations, “intense activity alternated with slack times,” whereas factory production was repetitive and continuous, requiring “coordinated activity by dozens or hundreds of workers, who were expected to start and stop work at the same time, day after day.”Now that factory work and stable, blue-collar jobs are such potent sources of nostalgia, it can be hard to recall how truly disruptive the manufacturing age was. Freeman does a superb job of reminding us. For an agrarian society like England, the factory generated a wistfulness for the bucolic agricultural past. The “dark Satanic Mills” bemoaned by William Blake were powered by steam and coal-fired boilers that belched smoke and soot. Seventy-hour work weeks were common. Male workers chafed at the constant supervision on the factory floor, and owners preferred not to employ men, anyway. “Today, in the United States, factories are associated with masculinity,” Freeman writes, “but in their early days they were spaces largely occupied by women and children.”Some of the details recounted here are familiar, though still appalling. In the 19th century, textile mills in New England — which were supposed to be gentler than the cruel depredations of the Old World — employed children as young as 4. Factory workers in Britain overwhelmed urban areas, crowding together in squalor. A Manchester official described streets “so covered with refuse and excrementitious matter as to be almost impassable from depth of mud, and intolerable from stench.”AdvertisementAs Freeman shows, what started inauspiciously became an engine for material abundance and, in the cases of the United States and the Soviet Union, a source of national pride. Factories, especially steel mills, became the behemoths of the book’s title, consolidations of equipment and labor on a massive scale. Freeman suggests the awe that these enormous structures must have inspired, describing how dignitaries attending the opening of a steel mill in 19th-century Maryland “rode in decorated gondola cars along the route iron ore would take,” ascending to a height of eight stories. Unlike the textile worker, who brought to mind wan images of a young woman or “a sickly child,” steelworkers were often portrayed “as intensely masculine, often bare-chested, with muscles rippling.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.With size and strength came strife too, as steel mills became sites for a bitter class war. Start-up costs were high, so a few big firms dominated the industry. Unions organized in response. Steel magnates like Andrew Carnegie resented any incursions on their freedom to set wages and working conditions at will; they wanted the right to squeeze labor to maintain profitability. The Homestead strike of 1892 turned into a literal conflagration, as steelworkers in Pennsylvania set the Monongahela River on fire.Freeman handles all of this material with the seriousness it deserves. If “Behemoth” can feel a little slow-going at times, that’s partly because of the knottiness of the history Freeman lays out, as well as his honorable refusal to resort to simplistic notions of grand progress or portentous doom.He shows how Henry Ford’s assembly-line innovations rendered his company both dominant and vulnerable: Switching to a new product in 1927 from the Model T required a wholesale overhaul of equipment and processes, costing Ford today’s equivalent of a cool $3.5 billion. Gigant industrialism in the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc showed its own seams and contradictions; for all the talk of a workers’ paradise, the Soviets eventually criminalized absenteeism, tardiness and “quitting without permission,” controlling labor in ways that would have made the most ruthless capitalist proud.Toward the end of “Behemoth,” Freeman finally arrives in China and Vietnam, where the factory system is still flourishing. Unlike the 20th-century behemoths of the United States, which were publicly showcased as marvels of ingenuity and industry, these new factories keep much of their work hidden. Freeman says Foxconn City in Shenzhen, China, might well be the largest factory ever, though the number of employees is hard to pin down: perhaps as many as 400,000 workers, making sleek and expensive gadgets like Apple’s iPhone.A spate of worker suicides at Foxconn captured the world’s attention in 2010 — at least for a while, though none of Foxconn’s major clients stopped using it. Nor did reports of Foxconn’s merciless and degrading environment put a dent in demand for Apple’s coveted products. Instead of substantively changing its production regime, Foxconn surrounded its factory buildings with yellow netting, to catch despairing workers before they hit the ground.Our brave new world of consumer goods is now fabricated in “bland, boring structures,” Freeman writes, designed for grim functionality as opposed to showing off: “Rather than representing an enlargement of the human spirit, modern factory giants often seem to symbolize its diminishment.” “Behemoth” doesn’t romanticize the earlier incarnations of gigantic factories, but Freeman understands why some people did — and still do.Follow Jennifer Szalai on Twitter: @jenszalai.Behemoth: A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern WorldBy Joshua B.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBy James B. StewartAs I zipped up the West Side Highway the other day in a gleaming red Tesla Model 3, I found myself wondering: Are American drivers ready for Autopilot?Autopilot is Tesla’s enhanced driver-assistance technology, which the company maintains is the most advanced system available. Tesla says all its vehicles “have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.”In this case, I was the human. I had tried a gull-wing Model X last fall with an earlier version of Autopilot, but since then the stakes — for both Tesla and consumers — have soared.On March 23, a driver was killed in Mountain View, Calif., after a Model X crashed into a concrete highway divider while Autopilot was in use. The fatal accident attracted intense media coverage and sent Tesla stock, long an investor favorite, into a nose dive.Four days later, Moody’s downgraded Tesla’s debt from stable to negative. Tesla was already so plagued with Model 3 production delays that its chief executive, Elon Musk, said he had been sleeping on the factory floor. By the beginning of this past week, Tesla shares had dropped over 30 percent from a peak of almost $390 a share last summer.Despite this wave of negative publicity, it seems clear that Tesla will rise or fall based on the performance, safety, design and value of its cars. If it gets those things right, all the other issues will sort themselves out. Tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die-hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all-electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics.That includes the Model 3, which Popular Mechanics named its 2018 Car of the Year. (It was a finalist for Motor Trend’s similar award. That it lost out to the Alfa Romeo Giulia has drawn howls of online protest.)When my Model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on Eighth Avenue, it didn’t quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull-wing doors on the Model X had, but I could see why the automotive press is so excited. The interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch-screen interface that houses nearly all the controls, many of them voice activated.With its Zen minimalism, it doesn’t look or feel like any other car I’ve been in. The synthetic-leather seats are comfortable, and there’s ample room for someone my size (6-foot-3). This all comes at a cost: $57,500 for this luxurious long-range version, far from the $35,000 base price that has excited many potential Tesla buyers.The Model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the X, but I found it nimble and responsive. I easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed, usually a nerve-racking maneuver in a conventional car. Driving the Model 3 was such a pleasure I was reluctant to cede any control to Autopilot.For someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car, my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock. The sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that I instinctively gripped the steering wheel, which immediately transferred control back to me.This time I was more relaxed, willing to see how the car would behave. I gave the voice-activated navigation system a destination (Garden State Plaza, a New Jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away), and the car accelerated, braked, stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three-car distance ahead of me, all without my intervention. At the mall, it detected an empty parking place, and flawlessly backed into it.One of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn-signal lever. The Tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane, waits for an opening and then glides into place, eliminating the danger of a blind spot. (Over the years I’ve experienced several close calls involving lane changes and blind spots.)Although I’d been briefed on its limitations, so successful was Autopilot that I was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror. That would have been a mistake.For all its vision capabilities (including in darkness), Autopilot became confused when lanes weren’t clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps. You can’t simply program the destination and let the car find its way. It’s reassuringly cautious about changing lanes, but in heavy traffic, I would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening, and had to assert manual control.While heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike, I could see in the rearview mirror a BMW bearing down at high speed. I pushed the turn signal for a lane change, and despite its ultrasonic sensors, the Tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car. It started to move into its lane; the driver laid on his horn, and I had to grab control to avoid an accident.Blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue.The Tesla owner’s manual describes this situation as one that the system can’t yet manage. Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.Tesla had no comment for this column.At this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. “This is not self-driving technology,” said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It’s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers’ hands and isn’t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.” Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.Self-driving automation systems are ranked from zero (no automation) to 5 (full automation). Tesla’s Autopilot is Level 2. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel. The car issues a prompt if it doesn’t detect a hand on the wheel, and Autopilot shuts down if there’s no response. In the Mountain View accident, Tesla has said, the driver “received several visual and one audible hands-on warning,” but “the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.”Given that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I’m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.“As technology supplants human performance,” Mr. Reimer said, “the bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That’s the big question no one wants to answer.”At the same time, he said, he worries that “intense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.” He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla’s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot “can’t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.” (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)After investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla S and a tractor-trailer in Florida, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found no flaws in the Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Autopilot had performed as intended, but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology.After my drive in the Model 3, my sense is that even with its flaws, Tesla’s Autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls, and enhances (rather than supplants) the driving experience. I’m tempted to join the Model 3 waiting list, which numbers over 400,000 customers.Investors, too, seem to have reassessed Tesla’s recent bad news. This past week, Tesla said it had succeeded in ramping up production of the Model 3, though it still fell short of targets, and had adequate capital for the rest of the year. From Monday morning through the end of trading Thursday, Tesla shares jumped more than 24 percent.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
technology,"PAID FOR AND POSTED BY MICROSOFTthe numbers defining drastic changes in the modern workplace are striking and relentless: five generations all working together, the role of automation in replacing or enhancing physically repetitive tasks (up to 55 percent), and an increase in telecommuting (115 percent over the last decade). But how do these numbers reflect the way we actually work and how productive we really are?Today, the answers are increasingly nuanced, characterized by a cycle of changes in the workplace — in large part catalyzed by tech — that provoke the anticipation of even more change. No longer is there a simple binary view of the old, traditional way of doing work typified by corner offices and strict dress codes, and the new, modern worker that does what they want, from wherever they are.A more enlightened view of how work is evolving takes cues from more than a century of office culture, while also incorporating cutting-edge advances in collaboration. These forces may seem paradoxical, even oppositional, but they can also be complementary. We’ll take a look at how some of the most drastic changes in the modern workplace have evolved to redefine what it means to work smarter.Millennials may have believed the office was obsolete. But too much working from home has left them seeking structure and the benefits of mentorship.mobile technology was going to untether workers from their work stations — eliminating long commutes and scotching many of the annoying distractions of office culture — all while facilitating new highs in productivity.The truth is, except for a blip from 1995 to 2005, overall productivity in Western economies has been largely stagnant for the past 50 years. Workers may feel more free, but, at least according to traditional measures, they’re not producing much more.And for many workers, separated from the interpersonal exchange of traditional offices, mobility has left them feeling disoriented. People want autonomy but, it turns out, they still crave structure and social interaction.After IBM sold its PC manufacturing division, for example, it encouraged its employees to work from wherever they wanted. Eventually, those employees quipped that IBM stood for “I’m By Myself.” They wanted an office to go to — at least part of the time.“That’s the surprise,” said Arvind Malhotra, a professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina who has studied workforce dynamics for over 20 years. “It’s a tacit admission that human contact has value in building organizational culture.”Ironically, the workers who most expect mobility — younger employees — are most adversely affected by it. One of the greatest causes of workplace anxiety, according to Malhotra, is a lack of mentorship.“Around 2001,” Malhotra said, “I started to hear young employees saying, ‘I feel like my boss doesn’t know that I’m working on really good stuff’ and ‘I’m not getting the one-on-one time with my mentor.’”On-the-job training is most intense in the early years of a career. Working from a cafe might result in great coffee options, but it robs young workers of crucial learning opportunities and mentorship when they need those most.Albert H. Segars, Malhotra’s collaborator and the PNC Distinguished Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina, said he believes, at least in the case of millennials, there’s a sociological factor involved: One of the things that make millennials different from other generations is a deeper level of parental involvement.Engagement among workers is at its lowest when employees aren’t given workplace flexibility. It’s highest among those who work remotely three to four days a week.Source: Gallup“Parents were deeply engaged with their well-being: the things millennials did or did not do growing up,” Segars said. “When they can’t get that at work, they get frustrated and think nobody is interested in them. When they do get it, it’s amazing what they can do. But they need some of the structure and feedback found in traditional workplaces.”Newer collaboration technology, however, can enable the very feedback loops young workers are missing, said Lisette Sutherland, an expert on working remotely and the author of the upcoming book “Work Together Anywhere.”“You have to make communicating with each other so easy that it’s like talking to someone right next to you,” Sutherland said. “It sounds really simple, but most multinational  workers don’t even have headsets. Another big part of it is turning the video on. People don’t realize how much team building you can do just by turning on the screen.”Sutherland said that the richer, real-time interface provided by a new wave of technological advances will help quell the isolation people feel when working at home. Robotic cameras that move through the halls of an office and pivot to look around a conference room will help remote workers feel more connected. “What we’re trying to do is replicate the human experience as much as possible,” she said.At a minimum, companies should supplement face-to-face leadership by teaming younger workers with digital mentors — someone in the organization with whom they can chat regularly for guidance and support — to eliminate anxiety fueled by greater mobility.Five generations are working together for the first time in history and turning to tech to bridge the generational gaps.increased mobility magnified another phenomenon unique to today’s workforce: For the first time, there are five generations working together — from the youngest of the Greatest Generation to the oldest of Gen Z.The arrival of millennials and other digital natives in the workforce over 15 years ago triggered some anxiety among older generations — how could they ever catch up? — but simultaneously generated high expectations.Indeed, 15 years ago young people entering the workforce had their own ideas about the future of work. They assumed their fluency with mobile devices and remote communications would free them to work on meaningful projects at their own discretion.In fact, the democratization of data — and their familiarity with how to access it — did allow younger employers to fuel their ambitions with information. Prior to digitalization, the ability to access information signaled power; in the new workforce, it signals ability.As early as 2015, millennials made up the majority of the global workforce, a trend expected to continue beyond 2025. Generation Z (not included in this graphic because of limited data available) will grow to become the demographic shaping the workplace.2015Source: Pew Research CenterBut as young workers forged new pathways, older managers struggled to evaluate their performance. The younger employees’ autonomous, remote work demanded new schemes for effective monitoring. Historically, much of how work got done depended on who knew whom in the organizational hierarchy, Malhotra said. But new ways of working meant managers had to promote group performance while also recognizing individual rewards — a dynamic most companies still struggle with.Younger workers clearly suffer from the waning of traditional monitoring and management. In a recent Gallup poll, only 21 percent of employees strongly agreed that their performance is managed in a way that motivates them to do outstanding work.Today, companies are finding that collaborative and sharing technology allows older workers to act as interpreters, applying their deeper experience to explain causes and implications for the patterns their younger colleagues unearth in data. The key is in providing better, more seamless communication tools. Electronic communication takes away two crucial elements in interpersonal interaction: voice tone and body language. Even today, many people working from home have slow internet speeds or patchy video-conferencing capabilities.Also, technology that allows people to share information with exactly the co-workers they want to — eliminating the endless CC’ed email chains, for instance — builds confidence in virtual communications. Providing intuitive, clear, seamless sharing tools helps workers of all ages become more comfortable in the way they interact. This allows firms to create teams of multigenerational workers, optimizing the skill sets of each generation and forging a functional melting pot for the ages.In the next wave of automation, robots will take on the routine, freeing humans to handle only the exceptions.since the luddites of the early 19th century sledgehammered machines they feared were taking away high-paying weaving jobs, little has created as much workplace anxiety as the specter of automation.But new weaving machines did not condemn England’s textile workers to massive unemployment — any more than ATMs mothballed bank tellers in the 1980s. (In spite of ubiquitous robotic cash dispensers, there are more human bank tellers today than ever.)“For 200 years, there has been the fear the machine will replace people,” said Harry Holzer, the LaFarge SJ Professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. “It’s never happened because the economy always has ways of generating new jobs to replace the ones that go away.”The benefits of automation are underestimated in the public imagination, Holzer said, while the negatives are generally overblown.“This prediction of doom and gloom, the fear of artificial intelligence that can do vastly more than machines in the past, so far we see very little evidence of this happening,” Holzer said. “Machines will do some of the tasks that workers did. That might free people up to be more complementary to machines than they used to be.”Historically, automation has replaced physically repetitive jobs, particularly in manufacturing. New automation featuring machine learning will affect different employee skills sets, augmenting many. Future workers will need to cultivate more social, emotional, creative and logical capabilities to work productively alongside machines.Net change in work hours due to automationSource: McKinseyThe next wave of automation will do even more routine tasks, allowing workers to pay attention to exceptional tasks. Machines, for instance, may soon read test results and diagnose a pathology as accurately as a doctor. Freed from that diagnostic work, doctors would be able to consider a patient’s personal factors — family or financial circumstances, say — to customize treatment options.“The problems, the projects, the things people are working on today have become much more complex,” Segars said.He and other experts agree that increased complexity is best addressed with even better technology. In the future workplace, winners and losers will be determined by the ability of companies to identify and adopt technologies that facilitate digital leadership and mentorship to enable seamless feedback.“The technology that enables us to fulfill our capacity as individuals and then fulfill our role on a team is of maximum value,” Segars said.Get the Practical Guide to the Modern WorkplaceThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation.Go to Home Page »"
technology,"AdvertisementSupported byArtificial intelligence video tools make it relatively easy to put one person’s face on another person’s body with few traces of manipulation. I tried it on myself. What could go wrong? By Kevin RooseThe scene opened on a room with a red sofa, a potted plant and the kind of bland modern art you’d see on a therapist’s wall. In the room was Michelle Obama, or someone who looked exactly like her. Wearing a low-cut top with a black bra visible underneath, she writhed lustily for the camera and flashed her unmistakable smile.Then, the former first lady’s doppelgänger began to strip.The video, which appeared on the online forum Reddit, was what’s known as a “deepfake” — an ultrarealistic fake video made with artificial intelligence software. It was created using a program called FakeApp, which superimposed Mrs. Obama’s face onto the body of a pornographic film actress. The hybrid was uncanny — if you didn’t know better, you might have thought it was really her.Until recently, realistic computer-generated video was a laborious pursuit available only to big-budget Hollywood productions or cutting-edge researchers. Social media apps like Snapchat include some rudimentary face-morphing technology. But in recent months, a community of hobbyists has begun experimenting with more powerful tools, including FakeApp — a program that was built by an anonymous developer using open-source software written by Google. FakeApp makes it free and relatively easy to create realistic face swaps and leave few traces of manipulation. Since a version of the app appeared on Reddit in January, it has been downloaded more than 120,000 times, according to its creator.Deepfakes are one of the newest forms of digital media manipulation, and one of the most obviously mischief-prone. It’s not hard to imagine this technology’s being used to smear politicians, create counterfeit revenge porn or frame people for crimes. Lawmakers have already begun to worry about how deepfakes could be used for political sabotage and propaganda. Even on morally lax sites like Reddit, deepfakes have raised eyebrows. Recently, FakeApp set off a panic after Motherboard, the technology site, reported that people were using it to create pornographic deepfakes of celebrities. Pornhub, Twitter and other sites quickly banned the videos, and Reddit closed a handful of deepfake groups, including one with nearly 100,000 members.Before the Reddit deepfake groups were closed, they hosted a mixture of users trading video-editing tips and showing off their latest forgeries. A post titled “3D face reconstruction for additional angles” sat next to videos with titles like “(Not) Olivia Wilde playing with herself.”Some users on Reddit defended deepfakes and blamed the media for overhyping their potential for harm. Others moved their videos to alternative platforms, rightly anticipating that Reddit would crack down under its rules against nonconsensual pornography. And a few expressed moral qualms about putting the technology into the world. Then, they kept making more. The deepfake creator community is now in the internet’s shadows. But while out in the open, it gave an unsettling peek into the future. “This is turning into an episode of Black Mirror,” wrote one Reddit user. The post raised the ontological questions at the heart of the deepfake debate: Does a naked image of Person A become a naked image of Person B if Person B’s face is superimposed in a seamless and untraceable way? In a broader sense, on the internet, what is the difference between representation and reality? The user then signed off with a shrug: “Godspeed rebels.”After lurking for several weeks in Reddit’s deepfake community, I decided to see how easy it was to create a (safe for work, nonpornographic) deepfake using my own face.I started by downloading FakeApp and enlisting two technical experts to help me. The first was Mark McKeague, a colleague in The New York Times’s research and development department. The second was a deepfake creator I found through Reddit, who goes by the nickname Derpfakes. Because of the controversial nature of deepfakes, Derpfakes would not give his or her real name. Derpfakes started posting deepfake videos on YouTube a few weeks ago, specializing in humorous offerings like Nicolas Cage playing Superman. The account has also posted some how-to videos on deepfake creation.What I learned is that making a deepfake isn’t simple. But it’s not rocket science, either.The first step is to find, or rent, a moderately powerful computer. FakeApp uses a suite of machine learning tools called TensorFlow, which was developed by Google’s A.I. division and released to the public in 2015. The software teaches itself to perform image-recognition tasks through trial and error. The more processing power on hand, the faster it works.To get more speed, Mark and I used a remote server rented through Google Cloud Platform. It provided enough processing power to cut the time frame down to hours, rather than the days or weeks it might take on my laptop.Once Mark set up the remote server and loaded FakeApp on it, we were on to the next step: data collection.Picking the right source data is crucial. Short video clips are easier to manipulate than long clips, and scenes shot at a single angle produce better results than scenes with multiple angles. Genetics also help. The more the faces resemble each other, the better. I’m a brown-haired white man with a short beard, so Mark and I decided to try several other brown-haired, stubbled white guys. We started with Ryan Gosling. (Aim high, right?) I also sent Derpfakes, my outsourced Reddit expert, several video options to choose from.Next, we took several hundred photos of my face, and gathered images of Mr. Gosling’s face using a clip from a recent TV appearance. FakeApp uses these images to train the deep learning model and teach it to emulate our facial expressions. To get the broadest photo set possible, I twisted my head at different angles, making as many different faces as I could.Mark then used a program to crop those images down, isolating just our faces, and manually deleted any blurred or badly cropped photos. He then fed the frames into FakeApp. In all, we used 417 photos of me, and 1,113 of Mr. Gosling.When the images were ready, Mark pressed “start” on FakeApp, and the training began. His computer screen filled with images of my face and Mr. Gosling’s face, as the program tried to identify patterns and similarities. About eight hours later, after our model had been sufficiently trained, Mark used FakeApp to finish putting my face on Mr. Gosling’s body. The video was blurry and bizarre, and Mr. Gosling’s face occasionally flickered into view. Only the legally blind would mistake the person in the video for me. We did better with a clip of Chris Pratt, the scruffy star of “Jurassic World,” whose face shape is a little more similar to mine. For this test, Mark used a bigger data set — 1,861 photos of me, 1,023 of him — and let the model run overnight. A few days later, Derpfakes, who had also been training a model, sent me a finished deepfake made using the footage I had sent and a video of the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. This one was much more lifelike, a true hybrid that mixed my facial features with his hair, beard and body.Derpfakes repeated the process with videos of Jimmy Kimmel and Liev Schreiber, both of which turned out well. As an experienced deepfake creator, Derpfakes had a more intuitive sense of which source videos would produce a clean result, and more experience with the subtle blending and tweaking that takes place at the end of the deepfake process.In all, our deepfake experiment took three days and cost $85.96 in Google Cloud Platform credits. That seemed like a small price to pay for stardom.After the experiment, I reached out to the anonymous creator of FakeApp through an email address on its website. I wanted to know how it felt to create a cutting-edge A.I. tool, only to have it gleefully co-opted by ethically challenged pornographers.A man wrote back, identifying himself as a software developer in Maryland. Like Derpfakes, the man would not give me his full name, and instead went by his first initial, N. He said he had created FakeApp as a creative experiment and was chagrined to see Reddit’s deepfake community use it for ill. “I joined the community based around these algorithms when it was very small (less than 500 people),” he wrote, “and as soon as I saw the results I knew this was brilliant tech that should be accessible to anyone who wants to play around with it. I figured I’d take a shot at putting together an easy-to-use package to accomplish that.”N. said he didn’t support the use of FakeApp to create nonconsensual pornography or other abusive content. And he said he agreed with Reddit’s decision to ban explicit deepfakes. But he defended the product.“I’ve given it a lot of thought,” he said, “and ultimately I’ve decided I don’t think it’s right to condemn the technology itself — which can of course be used for many purposes, good and bad.”FakeApp is somewhat finicky and hard to use, but it’s easy to imagine it improving quickly. N. said that in the future, FakeApp could be used by all kinds of people to bring high-budget special effects to their personal projects.Deep learning algorithms, he added, were going to be important in the future, not only as stand-alone apps but as powerful components of many tech products.“It’s precisely the things that make them so powerful and useful that make them so scary,” he said. “There’s really no limit to what you can apply it to with a little imagination.”On the day of the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., a screenshot of a BuzzFeed News article, “Why We Need to Take Away White People’s Guns Now More Than Ever,” written by a reporter named Richie Horowitz, began making the rounds on social media.The whole thing was fake. No BuzzFeed employee named Richie Horowitz exists, and no article with that title was ever published on the site. But the doctored image pulsed through right-wing outrage channels and was boosted by activists on Twitter. It wasn’t an A.I.-generated deepfake, or even a particularly sophisticated Photoshop job, but it did the trick.Online misinformation, no matter how sleekly produced, spreads through a familiar process once it enters our social distribution channels. The hoax gets 50,000 shares, and the debunking an hour later gets 200. The carnival barker gets an algorithmic boost on services like Facebook and YouTube, while the expert screams into the void.There’s no reason to believe that deepfake videos will operate any differently. People will share them when they’re ideologically convenient and dismiss them when they’re not. The dupes who fall for satirical stories from The Onion will be fooled by deepfakes, and the scrupulous people who care about the truth will find ways to detect and debunk them. “There’s no choice,” said Hao Li, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Southern California. Mr. Li, who is also the founder of Pinscreen, a company that uses artificial intelligence to create lifelike 3-D avatars, said the weaponization of A.I. was inevitable and would require a sudden shift in public awareness.“I see this as the next form of communication,” he said. “I worry that people will use it to blackmail others, or do bad things. You have to educate people that this is possible.”So, O.K. Here I am, telling you this: An A.I. program powerful enough to turn Michelle Obama into a pornography star, or transform a schlubby newspaper columnist into Jake Gyllenhaal, is in our midst. Manipulated video will soon become far more commonplace.And there’s probably nothing we can do except try to bat the fakes down as they happen, pressure social media companies to fight misinformation aggressively, and trust our eyes a little less every day.Godspeed, rebels.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp said on Sunday they had agreed to a $26 billion (18.8 billion pounds) all-stock deal and believed they could win over sceptical regulators because the merger would create thousands of jobs and help the United States beat China to creating the next generation mobile network.The agreement capped four years of on-and-off talks between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, setting the stage for the creation of a company with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the top two wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.U.S. regulators, who have challenged in court AT&T's $85 billion deal to buy U.S. media company Time Warner Inc, are expected to grill Sprint and T-Mobile on how they will price their combined wireless offerings. Verizon has 116 million U.S. wireless customers, according to a spokesman, while AT&T has 93 million branded customers, as of the first quarter.Their first round of merger talks ended unsuccessfully in 2014 after the administration of then-U.S. President Barack Obama expressed antitrust concerns.The new deal will create the highest-capacity U.S. network, lower prices, create jobs and improve service in rural areas, said John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile and the new head of the proposed combined company.The combined company, which will be called T-Mobile, will invest $40 billion over the next three years to upgrade its networks to accommodate the next generation 5G wireless technology, which is expected to have the speeds necessary to power drones and self-driving cars, Legere said in a statement.The companies said during a conference call with analysts that the recent U.S. tax overhaul would have a positive impact, and the combined company would not be a significant taxpayer until 2025.T-Mobile and Sprint said they expected to complete their deal no later than the first half of 2019, an ambitious goal given the intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny it will be subjected to. T-Mobile will not be liable to pay Sprint a breakup fee should regulators block the deal, according to sources who asked not to be identified because that detail in their contract had not yet been made public.The companies said they expected U.S. regulators would see the benefits of the deal.“This isn’t a case of going from four to three wireless companies – there are now at least seven or eight big competitors in this converging market,"" Legere said, referring to cable companies as wireless competitors. Other companies also would be forced to accelerate their investments in the face of a combined T-Mobile-Sprint, the companies added.A spokeswoman for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai declined to comment on Sunday on the proposed merger. The FCC will decide whether to grant the deal regulatory approval if it is in the “public interest,” the spokeswoman added.CTIA, a trade organization that represents the U.S. wireless communications industry, ranks the United States behind China and South Korea in 5G readiness. The Chinese government launched a plan targeting 5G deployment by 2020, with three carriers committed to the timeline.Legere said the deal would likely lead to lower prices from AT&T and Verizon, as well as Comcast Corp.AT&T declined to comment. Comcast could not immediately be reached for comment.Verizon declined to comment on prices but said it remained committed to building a 5G network. DEAL BREAKTHROUGHThe breakthrough in the companies' negotiations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday, came after T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom AG and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, agreed on a structure that would allow Deutsche Telekom to continue to consolidate the combined company, which will have a market value of over $80 billion, on its books.Deutsche Telekom will own 42 percent of the combined company, and will control the board of the combined company, nominating nine of the 14 directors. Legere will also serve as a director. The implied equity valuation for Sprint is $6.62 per share based on T-Mobile's closing share price on Friday. Sprint shares closed on Friday at $6.50.The all-stock transaction is at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile US share.Tokyo-based SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom will sign a voting rights agreement that will give Deutsche Telekom access to voting rights for a total of 69 percent of T-Mobile shares.The second round of talks between Sprint and T-Mobile ended in November over valuation disagreements.Since then, Sprint's shares lost about a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion.T-Mobile's market capitalization is $54.7 billion, while Sprint is valued by the deal at $26 billion.INVESTING IN 5G TECHNOLOGYEven though Sprint's customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market-share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody’s Investors Service Inc.T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans.Both Sprint and T-Mobile are far behind Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their network to accommodate next generation 5G wireless technology. Even after their merger, the combined company's budget to invest in 5G will be smaller than that of Verizon or AT&T.Sprint and T-Mobile hope the deal will give them more firepower to participate in auction for spectrum to develop 5G. They plan to participate in a spectrum auction in late autumn and will request a waiver if the merger prevents the companies from participating.PJT Partners, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Evercore served as advisers for T-Mobile. The Raine Group, J.P. Morgan and Centerview Partners LLC advised Sprint.  (Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis, Sheila Dang and Liana B.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersBEIJING — Chinese internet search giant Baidu Inc blew past earnings estimates on Thursday, sending its U.S.-listed shares sharply higher in after-hours trading as investors cheered strong growth in its advertising business.The firm, which has had to bounce back from a bruising medical advertising scandal in 2016, said it was now taking extra measures to clean up content on its platforms amid a fierce online crackdown by China's censors.Baidu's stock climbed 5.5 percent in late trading after marketing revenue grew 23 percent to 17.2 billion yuan ($2.71 billion), its second fastest quarterly rate in over two years. Net profit rose 23.4 percent versus forecasts of 19.5 percent.Baidu said it now expects second-quarter revenues of between 24.91 billion yuan ($3.93 billion) and 26.19 billion yuan ($4.13 billion), indicating a 19.3-25.4 percent rise versus estimates of a 15.9 percent climb according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The search firm's news feed received an unexpected bump in the first quarter due to a crackdown by Chinese internet regulators on low-brow content, which saw several competing apps targeted during a key client-acquisition period. Jinri Toutiao, one of China's most popular news feed apps and a key Baidu rival, is among the apps to have been punished by censors this year. The news feed platform was temporarily removed from local app stores earlier this month.""This is a one-off, but the timing is quite interesting. Baidu in its marketing can now assure clients that at least on the feed side it has safer content,"" said Pacific Epoch analyst Raymond Feng, adding it made the firm ""a more reliable choice"".Analysts said the early year bump boded well for the rest of 2018, as advertisers tended to sign year-long contracts. During a conference call with analysts on Friday, Chief Executive Robin Li said the company has employed artificial intelligence technology to target click-bait and inappropriate content. Baidu removed 20.2 billion malicious web pages in 2017.""We proactively clean up indecent content and limit the volume of entertainment gossip news in one sweep... We use AI to identify and remove clickbait and vulgar content... We believe such a strategy will pay off in the long run,"" said Li.The helping hand from censors is in stark contrast to Baidu's woes two years ago, when regulators cracked down on its advertising practices, gutting its marketing client base and bringing its revenue growth to a grinding halt. The company has since sold or withdrawn from a number of businesses to focus on autonomous driving, AI and its news feed product, regaining momentum and investor confidence. Baidu's total revenue rose about 24 percent to 20.91 billion yuan in the three months to March 31, its slowest rate in three quarters despite topping analyst estimates.The positive results also reflect lower-than-expected research and development expenses, which have sky-rocketed since Baidu's pivot to AI due to steep costs hiring top talent. Content costs linked to Baidu's newly listed entertainment subsidiary iQiyi Inc are also expected to squeeze its margins for the foreseeable future, amid stiff competition in online content from rival Tencent Holdings Ltd.Excluding one-time items, Baidu reported earnings of 16.30 yuan per American depositary share, above expectations of 10.57 yuan.Baidu's net income was also boosted by a new accounting standard that requires companies to report the value of their investments in private companies.($1 = 6.3405 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Cate Cadell in BEIJING; Additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil in BENGALURU; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Christopher Cushing)AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Raymond Zhong, Paul Mozur and Jack NicasThe United States undercut China’s technology ambitions on Tuesday, advancing a new rule that would limit the ability of Chinese telecommunications companies to sell their products in this country.The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to move forward with a plan that would prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to American national security. The decision takes direct aim at Huawei, which makes telecommunications network equipment and smartphones, and its main Chinese rival, ZTE, sending a message that the government doesn’t trust them.A day earlier, the government barred ZTE from using components made in the United States, saying the company had failed to punish employees who violated American sanctions against North Korea and Iran.The moves intensify an already testy fight between China and the United States for high-tech supremacy. Although tensions have simmered for years, the two economic powerhouses are threatening a global trade war as they look to protect their most advanced industries.Long bedeviled by political concerns about its ties to the Chinese government, Huawei (pronounced “HWA-way”) has spent the better part of the last decade trying to sell its equipment and phones in the United States.The company made a big push in the United States with a new line of smartphones this year. But that effort was derailed when AT&T, appearing to bow to government security concerns, walked away from a deal to sell the devices.Since then, Huawei has signaled that its political battles in Washington may be all but lost. The company has been dialing back on government outreach in the United States, including lobbying, and last week it cut key staff there, according to people familiar with the matter. The new F.C.C. rule, which would become final with a second vote, could kill off what little equipment business Huawei has in the United States.These are uncertain times for tech companies, whether American or Chinese, that are trying to do business across the Pacific. The two nations are playing an aggressive game of one-upsmanship, both to support their own companies and guard against threats to national security. Last month, the Trump administration accused Beijing of stealing American know-how as part of its ambitions to transform the Chinese economy, prompting tit-for-tat tariffs.The latest moves against Huawei and ZTE mean that American companies like Apple and Qualcomm could soon be caught in the crossfire — and they have a lot to lose. Apple, for example, sold $46.5 billion worth of iPhones and other products in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong last year. That was about 20 percent of its total sales.Wealthy Chinese consumers have gravitated toward Apple, and President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party still aim to keep the public happy. But there are limits to Apple’s leverage in the country.“Beijing will not sit idly by,” said Paul Triolo, who leads global technology policy analysis at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consultancy. “Chinese officials will likely pause to digest this move, and the series of other trade and investment moves coming at them in waves, before deciding how best to respond. It is likely to get ugly before it gets better.”Beijing could use its broad cybersecurity laws to steal the core computer code of American companies operating in China, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents the largest American tech companies. The Chinese government also could walk back recent commitments to allow more financial and electronic payments services from Mastercard, Visa and JPMorgan Chase. Or it could simply restrict American companies’ ability to do business in China, he said.For ZTE, this week’s sanctions are a nightmare come true. The company’s smartphones and network gear rely on American microchips and software, which means it could need to redesign as much as 90 percent of its product line.ZTE and Google, which supplies the Android operating system in the Chinese company’s phones, are concerned that the ban may prevent ZTE from licensing the software, according to a person familiar with the discussions but not permitted to speak publicly on the matter. No conclusion has been reached yet, the person said.Huawei is a global telecommunications equipment powerhouse, with $93 billion in revenue last year. It has spent millions trying to pry its way into the United States but found few takers — save for smaller, rural telecom companies that receive federal subsidies and would likely be barred from working with it by the F.C.C. rule.Huawei’s troubles in the United States have been mounting since 2012, when a congressional report warned that its gear could be used to spy on Americans or to destabilize American telecom networks. The company spent $1.2 million on lobbying that year. Last year, it spent $60,000.Major American carriers such as Verizon and AT&T have since shunned Huawei. The Commerce and Treasury Departments have subpoenaed it over possible violations of American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. And bills are before Congress to stop government agencies and contractors from buying Huawei products.In January, researchers discovered security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world’s computers. A Senate committee wrote to Huawei’s founder to ask what the company knew about the vulnerabilities, and how it had been affected by them. Huawei decided not to respond.Then, last week, Huawei laid off five American employees, including William B. Plummer, the executive who was the face of its Sisyphean efforts to win over Washington.The company has said repeatedly that its products pose no security risk and that it complies with the law everywhere it operates. Still, the layoffs appear to be an acknowledgment by Huawei that it has failed to clear the political cloud around it.“Some things cannot change their course according to our wishes,” Eric Xu, Huawei’s deputy chairman, said at the company’s annual meeting with analysts on Tuesday in its home city, Shenzhen. “With some things, when you let them go, you actually feel more at ease.”Mr. Plummer, who was Huawei’s vice president of external affairs, had been with the company for almost eight years. He was the most senior member of Huawei’s American policy team who was not a Chinese citizen.It is not clear whether he will be replaced. The company’s policy operations in the United States are led by a relatively recent arrival, Zhang Ruijun, who took the post nine months ago after working for the company in Mexico and Russia.A Huawei spokesman said in a statement that any layoffs simply reflected an effort to better align resources with “business strategy and objectives.”“Any changes to staffing size or structure are simply a reflection of standard business organization,” he said.In the United States, Huawei customers that would be affected by the F.C.C.’s proposed rule — small cellular carriers, largely in rural areas — may soon need to find new equipment suppliers.These carriers love Huawei gear, said Carri Bennet, general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association, an industry group for American telecom companies with fewer than 100,000 subscribers.The association’s members have even elected a Huawei executive, William Levy, to their board.Ms. Bennet said that rather than blacklisting specific manufacturers, Washington should be creating a system for testing telecom gear for security vulnerabilities.“These companies who are reliant on this support, they don’t have the funds to overhaul their whole network,” she said. “Public safety, getting 911 services, broadband — it all just starts falling apart.”Follow Raymond Zhong, Paul Mozur and Jack Nicas on Twitter: @zhonggg, @paulmozur and @jacknicas.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
technology,"AdvertisementSupported byWheelsBy Roy FurchgottJeffry Melnick didn’t want the hassle and anxiety of shopping for a car when he set out to buy one last year.“When they say to me, ‘Do you want to look under the hood?’ No,” Mr. Melnick said. “No, I don’t.”So he hired someone to do his haggling for him.Mr. Melnick, a semiretired theatrical agent who lives in Palm Springs, Calif., called Authority Auto, a car-buying service based in Tarzana, and told it what he wanted — and what he wanted to pay.Mr. Melnick favored a Mercedes-Benz GLE in Polar White with a modest option list that would keep the sport-utility vehicle in his price range. Although a dealer had told him that what he wanted wasn’t available in white, the negotiator got Mr. Melnick the GLE he was after — in white — with more options than he thought his budget would allow.“It’s very tricked out,” Mr. Melnick said. “I don’t like car shopping, but I do like gadgets.”Authority Auto is owned by Oren Weintraub, one of a small fraternity of negotiators who make a living doing exactly what most car buyers dread. Negotiators claim that their services protect consumers from unscrupulous dealers, save time and most of all save money on cars both new and used, whether bought or leased.Mr. Weintraub has periodically accepted a public challenge to prove his worth. In August, the syndicated TV program “Money Talks News” pitted him against the financial services company USAA (a partner of the buying service TrueCar) and the show’s host to buy a Mercedes that listed for more than $46,000. Mr. Weintraub’s total discount of more than $7,200 beat the next best deal by more than $2,000.But finding a negotiator can be tricky. There is no standard name for these services — some call themselves a buying service, others a negotiating service, some a broker, still others a concierge. Each seems to operate in its own way.Mr. Weintraub, a former car salesman, said he worked with buyers from start to finish. He will help them choose a car and negotiate the sales price, finance rate, and aftermarket products like service contacts and wheel and paint protection. He works nationwide and charges $600 to $1,500, depending on the cost of the car. For an additional $300 he will also sell the client’s old car.Mike Rabkin of From Car to Finish in Rockville, Md., does less initial consulting. Clients fill out an online order form for the model, color and options they want. Mr. Rabkin then has dealers bid for their business. Negotiating financing and aftermarket products is left to the client. He charges $250.Greg Macke, who calls himself “Your Car Angel,” helps clients pick a car, arranges a test drive, negotiates the purchase and accompanies the buyer to a dealership. He even inspects used cars. But he accepts only clients who live near Los Angeles for his $750 service.“The key to inspections is laying eyes on the car,” he said.Paul Maloney is a New York-based former fleet director with an Australian accent and a snappy line of patter. He calls his business the Car Leasing Concierge, although he handles new-car sales as well. He sends clients to a dealership with a free work sheet, then, for a fee, he will assess the deal to see if he can beat it. His is a tiered service that tops out with his assessing your deal and handling your purchase for $297.You might think dealerships tremble at their approach, but the negotiators — who said they helped with between 125 and 1,000 purchases a year — say that is not the case.“We buy so much merchandise from them that we are an asset to them,” said Greg Pence, manager of car-buying services for AAA Carolinas, whose in-house service buys about 1,200 cars a year. He said dealerships liked that the professional negotiators closed deals quickly, “usually within a good 30 minutes or so.”The negotiators compete with services like TrueCar, which don’t charge the consumer but do charge the dealers — who may pass the cost on to the consumer.Michael S. Freeman II, the executive manager of Sunset Chevrolet Buick GMC in Sarasota, Fla., said the average profit on a car was 2 percent. On a $30,000 car that would be $600. TrueCar, he said, charges a fee of $300 for each new car sold on a referral.“When we get someone from TrueCar, we have to cut a check,” Mr. Freeman said. “That is factored into the price.”TrueCar is the technology behind 500 buying services, like those of publications like Car & Driver and U.S. News and World Report, and companies like USAA and Sam’s Club. The dealers get their referrals from TrueCar, which displays prices from its member dealerships and allows prospective buyers to compare the out-the-door cost for the vehicle they want. That eliminates haggling — for better or worse.The details of how a dealer reaches the price that TrueCar displays are complex, said Veronica Cardenas, a spokeswoman for TrueCar, but “it’s not a race to the bottom.” She added, “The idea is you are getting a competitive price.”There are competitors that charge dealerships a modest monthly fee, such as Costco and CarGurus, which dealers said gave them more room to discount. (Sometimes, getting the very best deal comes from buying at just the right time. Dealers receive bonuses based on sale quotas, meaning they might give bigger discounts if they’re trying to hit a benchmark. On the other hand, that means dealers might not know how profitable a deal is for them until well after a sale agreement is signed.)Several negotiators warned that competitors took money from dealerships and colluded on deals. The negotiation industry isn’t regulated, nor is it represented by a trade group. Customers have to make a best guess using online reviews to determine if a buying service is a good fit, and that information can be ambiguous.Take, for instance, Mr. Rabkin, who has a spotless A-plus rating from the Better Business Bureau. There are two reviews on Angie’s List for 2017, an A and a B grade, and he has a slew of overwhelmingly positive testimonials on LinkedIn and Yelp. But the most recent of those testimonials are dated 2015. Mr. Rabkin pointed out he had no control over when people reviewed his service online.Hiring a pro buyer is likely to save you money, but not more than you can save yourself, said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a trade group of consumer lawyers.“There is enough information out there today that you don’t have to be the most sophisticated buyer to know what the real cost should be,” he said. “You don’t need a buying service unless you are intimidated by the process, and there are those people.”For people who are anxious about car buying, or whose time is too valuable to spend it bargaining over a sticker price, a buying service can be worthwhile. But there are also buyers who hire a professional negotiator because they aim to bully every last nickel out of a dealership. Because of the nature of industry incentives, though, they can never really know if they achieved that goal.“Those people,” Mr. Rheingold said, “need to get a life.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • What to expect from Powell’s first Fed meeting.• Trump, tariffs and the G20.• Pressure continues to mount on Facebook.• Facebook had a terrible day.• So did Uber.• Leaders at the G-20 summit are still trying to avert a trade war.Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here.Federal Reserve policymakers conclude their March rate-setting meeting on Wednesday. It is the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank’s new chairman.With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year.AdvertisementAfter the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.AdvertisementHere’s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting:Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs: “Public remarks by Fed officials suggest a broad shift in the committee’s outlook towards a potentially faster pace of tightening, and we expect the median dot to show four hikes in 2018, up from three at the December meeting. Additional hawkish changes—a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer-run funds rate estimates—are also possible but not our base case.”Michelle Meyer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Ms. Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting, but “unlike December where there were two dissents, we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction. The focus will be on the evolution of the dots: we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year, but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019. We also think the long-run dot will edge up to 2.875%. This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes, but without an urgency to front-load the tightening.”Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics: Mr. Powell “is bound to be faced with questions along the lines of “Why are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial, unfunded fiscal easing?”. His reply, we suspect, will be something like: “It’s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy, and it’s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases. Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent, and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up, so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation. In any event, with inflation well below target, gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening.”Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont: “The bulk of the interest in this week’s F.O.M.C. meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F.O.M.C. statement. Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction, though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different.”Steve Rick, CUNA Mutual Group: There is “a very strong case for not only raising rates this week, but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017. I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three, with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well.”Chris Zaccarelli, Independent Advisor Alliance: “Whether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn’t be that big of a difference to the economy, but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology. Every statement – whether spoken or written – will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1% higher (or only 75 bps) a year from now.”President Trump’s plan to hit countries around the world with stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum has dominated a gathering of world economic leaders amid fears that the United States is on the cusp of starting an international trade war.AdvertisementOn Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security.In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced “relatively quickly.”Mr. Mnuchin said:“I think we’ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don’t think anything should be a surprise. This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.”Mr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States’ national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.Countries including France, Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr. Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs, arguing that, as United States allies, they should not be penalized on national security grounds. Mr. Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case-by-case basis and that there was not a one-size-fits-all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt. The tariffs go into effect on Friday.— Alan RappeportThe Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy, reports Cecilia Kang of the NYT.The probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The investigation, started in recent days, adds to the mounting pressureagainst Facebook in the United States and in the United Kingdom about its handling of the data. Cambridge Analytica used the information to help President Trump’s presidential campaign profile voters during the 2016 election.The F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers “by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,” according to a statement at the time.AdvertisementFacebook could face fines of thousands of dollars a day per violation if the commission finds Facebook violated terms of the settlement, Bloomberg reports.Shares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading.Exhibit A: Its stock closed down nearly 7 percent, its worst performance in four years.Exhibit B: Its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, plans to leave after disagreements about how much the company should share about misuse of its platform. (He favored disclosure.)The overall problem: Reports about how the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users are highlighting just how much governments itch to regulate the tech giant.And Facebook’s previous laissez-faire attitude toward data collection by apps has gone from feature to bug, Kevin Roose writes in his latest column.Peter Eavis’s take: Mark Zuckerberg’s unusually powerful position at the company may have played a role:Through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.More on Cambridge Analytica: An undercover investigation by Channel 4 News of Britain captured the firm’s C.E.O., Alexander Nix, suggesting the entrapment of a potential client’s political opponents with women and bribes. Britain’s information commissioner is now seeking a warrant to examine the firm’s data. And Facebook has hired a forensics firm to audit it.Critics’ corner• Jeff Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes, “Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his start-up into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.”• The academic Zeynep Tufekci writes, “This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.”Advertisement• Cass Sunstein of Bloomberg View writes, “It would be a mistake to take the fiasco as a reason to keep treasure troves of information out of the hands of people who can provide immensely valuable services with it.”• Dan Gallagher of Heard on the Street writes, “Facebook’s immense scale also has made it virtually impossible for alternatives to catch on. That, in turn, makes abuse of the platform more urgent for lawmakers.”Public service announcements: How to protect yourself on Facebook. Oxford Analytica, an advisory group, wants you to know it’s not like that. And a little joke for those steeped in the British university system:Uber has suspended its autonomous vehicle testing in four cities after a car in self-driving mode struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Ariz. Until now, regulators had been increasingly open to testing: Just this month, California said it would start letting self-driving cars operate without anyone behind the wheel. Arizona already had.The head of Carnegie Mellon’s self-driving car lab has urged a halt to testing, telling Axios, “The technology is not there yet.”The virtual currencies corner: The White House banned Venezuela’s virtual currency in a new round of sanctions.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersSAN FRANCISCO — Ducking analysts' questions has a price: $2 billion.Tesla Inc investors gave a rare rebuke to iconoclastic Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday after he cut off analysts asking about profit potential, sending shares down 5 percent despite promises that production of the troubled Model 3 electric car was on track.Tesla's future depends on the Model 3 and the company said that it had largely overcome production bottlenecks, with Musk vowing a dramatic turnaround that would reverse losses and generate positive cash flow in just a few months. Musk plans to shut down its Fremont, California factory for 10 days in the second quarter but said Tesla will meet the production target of 5,000 Model 3s per day by the end of June, as planned, and will turn a profit in the second half of the year. To achieve profitability, Musk will have to reverse what today amounts to a $22,584 pre-tax loss per vehicle built by the Silicon Valley company. Tesla posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss when it announced first-quarter results on Wednesday.Tesla stock was little changed after the earnings announcement but fell during a conference call, when Musk began cutting analysts' questions short, costing Tesla over $2 billion in market capitalization. ""These questions are so dry. They're killing me,"" Musk said after an analyst asked what percentage of Tesla 3 reservation holders have started to configure options for their cars, an indicator of how much profit Tesla will be able to wring from the vehicles. Another analyst asked about a capital requirement before being cut off. He then took several questions in a row about plans for a self-driving car network and other long-term projects from the host of a YouTube channel focused on investing, praising the questions as not boring. (For a graphic on Tesla earnings click http://tmsnrt.rs/2p6EbiR)5,000 MODEL 3s PER WEEKMusk's ability to run Tesla is crucial as the company strives to efficiently and profitably build its first vehicle intended to be produced at high volume, the Model 3.Musk acknowledged error recently in over-automating the Model 3 assembly-line, which has resulted in production delays, but it is still unclear how long and costly it will be to unwind this mistake.Delayed Model 3 production also comes as a slew of competitors bring new electric vehicle models to market. The company stood by a previously announced target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June.Tesla's capital expenditures declined in the quarter and the company cut its spending forecasts for 2018, saying it would spend less than $3 billion. Tesla spent $3.4 billion in 2017. (https://bit.ly/2jn15SB) Investing.com analyst Clement Thibault said the reduction was noteworthy, ""but in the long run given challenges that lay ahead of Tesla, I don't think it is going to make or break the company.""Tesla ""is definitely not in a minimizing cost stage,"" Thibault said. Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business. Analysts had not expected so much spending, predicting hundreds of millions of dollars less in so-called cash burn, according to Thomson Reuters data.Tesla did not break out a cash flow calculation that it had included in previous quarters.The niche carmaker, which two years ago vowed to build 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018, has attracted legions of fans for its advanced technology and design. But the company rushed its Model 3 to market, making mistakes in manufacturing whose effects are now being felt, and investor skepticism has risen.Questions over Tesla's finances are top of mind, and many analysts anticipate a capital raise in 2018 despite Musk's statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters. Tesla said gross margins on the Model 3, which today are slightly negative, would be close to flat in the second quarter and grow to ""highly positive"" in the second half of the year.Tesla said it produced 2,270 Model 3s per week in the last week of April. It said net reservations for the Model 3, including configured orders not yet delivered, exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.Automotive revenue rose only 1 percent from the prior quarter to $2.74 billion.RECORD LOSSTesla reported a record loss of $709.6 million, or $4.19 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $330.3 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, Tesla had a loss of $3.35 per share. Analysts had expected a loss of $3.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said it ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash after spending $655.7 million in quarterly capital expenses.The lack of Model 3 revenue has exacerbated Tesla's cash burn as the company continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on multiple projects in the pipeline, such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory.The Model Y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for Tesla, which also launched a Tesla Semi and a new Roadster in recent months.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - Intel Corp beat earnings expectations for the first quarter and raised its full-year revenue and profit forecasts on Thursday, driven by the biggest-ever quarterly jump in its data centre business and small-but-steady growth in its personal computer business.Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker rose 5.4 percent to $55.95 in after-market trading after it said it expects full-year revenue of $67.5 billion, up $2.5 billion from prior guidance.Intel has been focussed on transforming itself from a supplier of processors for personal computers to a maker of chips for growing data centre business and newer areas such as driverless cars and artificial intelligence. That shift appeared to be taking hold as revenues for Intel's data centre business accounted for almost half of the company's revenue in the first quarter, the highest proportion ever.""They certainly outperformed the most bullish expectations,"" said Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group.Intel said fresh demand for applications such as artificial intelligence fuelled the data centre business. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan warned that the brisk growth of that business in the past two quarters, particularly from business customers building out their own computing clouds, would be hard to match in the second half the year.""We do expect there to be deceleration for [data centre business] growth from first half to second half for sure,"" Swan said on a conference call with investors. ""We hope we're wrong.""Still, the better-than-expected results and brighter forecast pushed shares to their highest in at least five years. The data centre results also suggest the chipmaker's large customers have not been deterred by two chip flaws that emerged earlier this year.Intel said it plans to allot $14.5 billion to capital spending this year, much of which will go towards building up its relatively new memory chip business.But the company also said $1.7 billion of its free cash flow for the quarter came from long-term supply agreements for its memory business, which could help protect the company against a drop in memory prices that has spooked chip investors this year. That business grew 20 percent year over year to $1 billion.Intel executives also said that the unit that contains its modem chips that help Apple Inc 's iPhones connect to mobile data business will grow faster than the rest of Intel's sales. Intel's Swan said investments in that division to ramp it up could compress Intel's margins in the short term.Last fall, Reuters reported that Apple had designed iPhones and iPads that could drop Qualcomm Inc's modem chips in favour of Intel chips, though it is not clear Apple has yet made a final decision. Revenue from Intel's client computing business, which supplies chips to PC makers and is the biggest contributor to sales, rose 3 percent to $8.2 billion, beating estimates of $7.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue from the data centre business posted a record gain of 24 percent to $5.2 billion, beating estimates of $4.73 billion.The company's net income rose to $4.45 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $2.96 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier.Net revenue rose to $16.07 billion from $14.80 billion.Excluding items, the chipmaker earned 87 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting Intel to report a profit of 72 cents per share on a revenue of $15.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Common Sense By                     
 JAMES B. STEWART
 
MARCH 29, 2018
Over the last half decade, few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook. No wonder: After a rocky initial public offering in 2012, it has rolled over one obstacle after another, including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing. It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections.By the end of last year, Facebook had 2.2 billion active users. Its stock rose 53 percent last year, single-handedly accounting for 3.7 percent of the 21.8 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, according to S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. By early February, its market capitalization had surpassed $560 billion, making it the fifth most valuable company in the index.By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S.&P. 500 index, which means that anyone who owns a broad-based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares. Sophisticated investors and institutions, too, have considerable exposure: Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock (after Amazon) by hedge funds.Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a “buy” in early February, even though, at $195 a share, its price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation measure, was a lofty 35. (The average ratio now is about 24; historically, it has been about 15.)AdvertisementIt was, as Wall Street pundits like to say, “priced for perfection.”Whatever else can be said about Facebook’s recent tribulations, this much is certain: Its situation is far from perfection.AdvertisementAfter revelations that data harvested from Facebook may have been used to try to influence Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the United States presidential election, the social network giant faces multiple investigations in both Europe and the United States, along with potentially profit-crimping regulations and limits to its use of data. And investor retribution has been swift.Since hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.)With Facebook’s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks — Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google — and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak.
            Since 2014, Facebook has been one of the hottest stocks in the market, but its recent troubles have caused it to lose about a quarter of its value.        +400%Facebookstock price+300+200+100I.P.O.S.& P. 500-stock index0–100’12’18MARCH 29, 2018
“People who own an index fund need to realize how important Facebook is, and how big a role it and the FANG stocks played in the market’s rise,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior industry analyst for the S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, who oversees statistical analysis for the S.&P. 500. “The FANG leadership is faltering. Social media hasn’t faced much regulation, and now there’s a cloud hanging over those companies.”In the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a “sell” recommendation for Facebook last fall.So did Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group  who covers media and internet companies. Although he was positive about the stock for most of its long climb, he downgraded Facebook to “sell” last summer based on regulatory and advertiser concerns and what he now considers “systemic management issues.”Not only was it a lonely position, but “the stock went up and up,” Mr. Wieser told me this week. “But I thought the market was wrong, full stop.”Advertisement“I didn’t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,” he said. “There are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.”Then, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was “the most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

This is digital advertising’s original sin, and there’s going to be a reckoning that even now I don’t think most investors fully appreciate.”The other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo — whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey — wasn’t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera’s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia’s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.)Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook.That included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell.When I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. “Aiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,” Mr. Sena said. “But it’s not meant to supplant human judgments.”He hasn’t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. “The conventional wisdom was that people don’t care that much about how their data is used,” Mr. Sena said. “They like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.’’“Facebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,’’ he added. “I believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it’s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.”AdvertisementEven so, Facebook’s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out.When he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser’s price target was $152. “I don’t want to be trigger happy on this,” he said. “It’s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.”Aiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn’t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a “buy” or “overweight” recommendation, up from 39 a month ago.Mr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn’t changed his price target of $230. “People are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,” he said.Its price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it “the cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,” he said. “There’s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.”Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Facebook’s chief executive. He is Mark Zuckerberg, not Jeff.A version of this article appears in print on March 30, 2018, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: As Facebook Loses Luster, Tech Stocks Await Fallout.

The growth rate was the slowest in three quarters but topped analysts' average prediction of a 19.8 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Baidu has been trying to reignite sales growth since the advent of strict search ad regulations in 2016. The rules prompted a major strategy shift and the company has since sold or withdrawn from a number of businesses to focus on autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and its news feed product.The company expects second-quarter revenue of between 24.91 billion yuan ($3.93 billion) and 26.19 billion yuan ($4.13 billion).AdvertisementThe high costs of content for its newly listed online video unit iQiyi as well as money spent to acquire AI engineers is expected to weigh on Baidu's profit margins for some time.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Sapna MaheshwariAmazon ran a commercial on this year’s Super Bowl that pretended its digital assistant Alexa had temporarily lost her voice. It featured celebrities like Rebel Wilson, Cardi B and even the company’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos.While the ad riffed on what Alexa can say to users, the more intriguing question may be what she and other digital assistants can hear — especially as more people bring smart speakers into their homes.Amazon and Google, the leading sellers of such devices, say the assistants record and process audio only after users trigger them by pushing a button or uttering a phrase like “Hey, Alexa” or “O.K., Google.” But each company has filed patent applications, many of them still under consideration, that outline an array of possibilities for how devices like these could monitor more of what users say and do. That information could then be used to identify a person’s desires or interests, which could be mined for ads and product recommendations.In one set of patent applications, Amazon describes how a “voice sniffer algorithm” could be used on an array of devices, like tablets and e-book readers, to analyze audio almost in real time when it hears words like “love,” bought” or “dislike.” A diagram included with the application illustrated how a phone call between two friends could result in one receiving an offer for the San Diego Zoo and the other seeing an ad for a Wine of the Month Club membership.Some patent applications from Google, which also owns the smart home product maker Nest Labs, describe how audio and visual signals could be used in the context of elaborate smart home setups.One application details how audio monitoring could help detect that a child is engaging in “mischief” at home by first using speech patterns and pitch to identify a child’s presence, one filing said. A device could then try to sense movement while listening for whispers or silence, and even program a smart speaker to “provide a verbal warning.”A separate application regarding personalizing content for people while respecting their privacy noted that voices could be used to determine a speaker’s mood using the “volume of the user’s voice, detected breathing rate, crying and so forth,” and medical condition “based on detected coughing, sneezing and so forth.”The same application outlines how a device could “recognize a T-shirt on a floor of the user’s closet” bearing Will Smith’s face and combine that with a browser history that shows searches for Mr. Smith “to provide a movie recommendation that displays, ‘You seem to like Will Smith. His new movie is playing in a theater near you.’”In a statement, Amazon said the company took “privacy seriously” and did “not use customers’ voice recordings for targeted advertising.” Amazon said that it filed “a number of forward-looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology,” and that they “take multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services.”Google said it did not “use raw audio to extrapolate moods, medical conditions or demographic information.” The company added, “All devices that come with the Google Assistant, including Google Home, are designed with user privacy in mind.”Tech companies apply for a dizzying number of patents every year, many of which are never used and are years from even being possible.Still, Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group in Santa Monica, Calif., which published a study of some of the patent applications in December, said, “When you read parts of the applications, it’s really clear that this is spyware and a surveillance system meant to serve you up to advertisers.”The companies, Mr. Court added, are “basically going to be finding out what our home life is like in qualitative ways.”Google called Consumer Watchdog’s claims “unfounded,” and said, “Prospective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patent applications.”A recent Gallup poll found that 22 percent of Americans used devices like Google Home or Amazon Echo. The growing adoption of smart speakers means that gadgets, some of which contain up to eight microphones and a camera, are being placed in kitchens and bedrooms and used to answer questions, control appliances and make phone calls. Apple recently introduced its own version, called the HomePod.But many consumers are also becoming increasingly nervous that tech companies are eavesdropping on them in order to serve them targeted ads, no matter how often the companies deny it. The recent revelations that a British political data firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users has only added to the public’s wariness over the collection and use of personal information.Facebook, in fact, had planned to unveil its new internet-connected home products at a developer conference in May, according to Bloomberg News, which reported that the company had scuttled that idea partly in response to the recent fallout.Both Amazon and Google have emphasized that devices with Alexa and Google Assistant store voice recordings from users only after they are intentionally triggered. Amazon’s Echo and its newer smart speakers with screens use lights to show when they are streaming audio to the cloud, and consumers can view and delete their recordings on the Alexa smartphone app or on Amazon’s website (though they are warned online that “may degrade” their experience). Google Home also has a light that indicates when it is recording, and users can similarly see and delete that audio online.Amazon says voice recordings may help fulfill requests and improve its services, while Google says the data helps it learn over time to provide better, more personalized responses.But the ecosystem around voice data is still evolving.Take the thousands of third-party apps developed for Alexa called “skills,” which can be used to play games, dim lights or provide cleaning advice. While Amazon said it didn’t share users’ actual recordings with third parties, its terms of use for Alexa say it may share the content of their requests or information like their ZIP codes. Google says it will “generally” not provide audio recordings to third-party service providers, but may send transcriptions of what people say.And some devices have already shown that they are capable of recording more than what users expect. Google faced some embarrassment last fall when a batch of Google Home Minis that it distributed at company events and to journalists were almost constantly recording.In a starker example, detectives investigating a death at an Arkansas home sought access to audio on an Echo device in 2016. Amazon resisted, but the recordings were ultimately shared with the permission of the defendant, James Bates. (A judge later dismissed Mr. Bates’s first-degree murder charge based on separate evidence.)Kathleen Zellner, his lawyer, said in an interview that the Echo had been recording more than it was supposed to. Mr. Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted, and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands, including a conversation about football in a separate room, she said.“It was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred,” Ms. Zellner said.The Electronic Privacy Information Center has recommended more robust disclosure rules for internet-connected devices, including an “algorithmic transparency requirement” that would help people understand how their data was being used and what automated decisions were then being made about them.Sam Lester, the center’s consumer privacy fellow, said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used.“A lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers,” he said. “But it’s not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it’s their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs. It’s why we established a Food and Drug Administration years ago.”Contact Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or follow her on Twitter: @sapna.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
technology,"AdvertisementWith Andrew Ross SorkinMARCH 28, 2018
Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching.• Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania?• Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.•Are investors waking up to Tesla’s real problem?• Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress.• SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world’s largest solar energy project.Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.AdvertisementStocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.AdvertisementStill, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we’ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company’s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won’t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla’s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla’s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap’s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.— Peter EavisThe reason?AdvertisementReports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.Jonathan Swan of Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported:“Trump has talked about changing Amazon’s tax treatment because he’s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.”Mr. Swan added:“Trump’s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.”Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday, but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment. But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues.How concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:“While it’s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company’s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.”Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon's woes? Retailers, the FT points out.On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy’s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl’s was up 2.4 percent.The electric carmaker’s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.Tuesday’s slide was driven, in part, by the National Transportation Safety Board’s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California. News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit probably didn't help either.But the continued decline in Tesla’s stock — its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March — speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3. Late Tuesday, Moody’s downgraded Tesla’s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative. The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than $2 billion.Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla’s stock price but also in the trading of its debt. The FT points out that “Tesla’s eight-year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87.6 cents to the dollar, the lowest since issuance. The yield has surged to 7.5 percent from 6.59 percent on Monday.”Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:“Challenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.“Given Tuesday’s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?”The fallout from Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research’s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.
            Citron short $TWTR. Near-Term target $25 Of all social media, they are most vulnerable to privacy regulation Wait until Senate finds out what Citron has published. https://t.co/nAkRWb8Kcn But analysts at Barclays disagree. They argue in a recent note to clients that Twitter’s data business likely won’t be impacted much by any regulation on its use of user data. The credit reporting company named Mark Begor, a private equity executive who once led General Electric’s credit card business, as its new chief executive.AdvertisementMr. Begor, 59, takes over for Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., who has filled the role on an interim basis since September, when Richard F. Smith stepped down after a data breach exposed sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, of 148 million people.Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.About Mr. Begor• The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO.• Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate’s real-estate investment and energy management units. For nine years, he was president and chief executive of the company’s consumer credit business, which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial.His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million.President Trump has scored a significant trade deal with South Korea.But with Mr. Trump preparing to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un — who just took an armored train trip to Beijing — and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments, an “America first” trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign. More from Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport:The political success of the trade agreement — and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations — is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington’s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president’s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China. Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. tech. A separate plan to enact tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted. Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war, the WSJ reports.And nations are already reacting to Trump’s trade moves, erecting  barriers to stop the steel and aluminum that faces tariffs in the U.S. being dumped in their markets.AdvertisementAgainst this background, NXP sold its 40 percent stake in a Chinese joint venture on chip design.Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.But that confidence is evaporating, as investors brace for intensified regulatory scrutiny across the industry. Tech stocks took a pummeling yesterday and in early European trading.Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left’s Citron Research said it was shorting the company.Critic’s corner: The “sector’s growing clout over everyday life also raises the risks of what can go wrong,” Dan Gallagher argues at WSJ’s Heard on the Street.The public outcry over Facebook’s data and privacy settings has grown loud enough that Mark Zuckerberg now says he’s willing to testify to Congress.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBy Scott MalcomsonMr. Malcomson is the author of “Splinternet: How Geopolitics and Commerce Are Fragmenting the World Wide Web.”Is Silicon Valley going to war? In 2013, Amazon beat IBM for a contract to host the United States intelligence community’s data cloud. Microsoft now markets Azure Government Secret, its cloud-computing service designed specifically for federal and local governments, to the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. And last year, Google signed a contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven, a pilot program to accelerate the military’s use of artificial intelligence.These partnerships might ease anxiety in the Defense Department about China’s artificial-intelligence advances and ominous, state-led fusion of civil and military technology development. But a comparable fusion of the United States government and Silicon Valley would be a mistake.This is not so much because it would compromise Silicon Valley values, as more than 3,000 Google employees argued in a recent letter about Project Maven to the company’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai. Rather, it’s because the United States’ edge in techno-military competition exists in great part because we have a tech sector that is not dominated by the state and its needs.Narrowing the focus of the United States tech sector to the needs of the military would serve neither party. On the contrary, it would make the nation weaker.To be sure, defense contracts are hardly new in Silicon Valley, and Google’s recent moves might be seen as heralding Silicon Valley’s return to its natural home in defense contracting. But that would be to misunderstand both Silicon Valley history and today’s technology.The internet and much of digital computing did indeed emerge from decades of United States defense contracts, beginning as long ago as World War I. Yet the Pentagon itself sloughed off the internet — not knowing quite what to do with it, and rightly judging it to be insecure — to the National Science Foundation. When the internet became a commercial concern, the National Science Foundation off-loaded it to the Department of Commerce. Government might have given birth to the internet, but it sure didn’t raise it.The emergence of a civilian, entrepreneurial tech culture in the 1970s owed as much intellectually, if not (at first) financially, to the antiwar movement and the 1960s counterculture — hardly friends of the military-industrial complex. Out of this the dominant, highly creative ethos of geek antiauthoritarianism grew. It is hard to believe that closer ties with the military would perpetuate this culture of innovation.The technology involved in projects like Azure Government Secret and Project Maven is also very different from the data-sharing projects of the 1960s. Those older technologies would not have been created in the absence of government funding. Today’s projects, in contrast, are all basically A.I. plays. Very little of this is defense-specific, but all of it is useful for defense and espionage. Unlike, say, weapons development, A.I. research is inherently dual-use. United States tech giants would be pursuing it with or without government contracts. Silicon Valley does not need the Pentagon to initiate these endeavors.The Pentagon is in a different position. It came around very reluctantly to the idea that it is dependent on private industry for the defense of the country and the projection of American power. But come around it has, in no small part thanks to China.China’s state interest in A.I. was initially economic, but military uses were never far behind. As Elsa B. Kania, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security, explained in an influential report, “A.I. is a high-level priority within China’s national agenda for military-civil fusion,” a strategy that should allow the Chinese armed forces to benefit from private-sector advances in A.I.The United States military seems to have been spooked. In a 2017 memo, the deputy secretary of defense, Robert O. Work, wrote that while the Defense Department had made “tentative steps” in A.I., “we need to do much more, and move much faster.” The memo announced the formation of Project Maven to do just that. This month, Gen. Stephen Wilson, the vice chief of staff for the Air Force, said that China is taking a “whole of nation” approach to A.I. and the United States should, too.Yet we shouldn’t forget that civil-military antagonism and the deep American tradition of distrusting the state have been crucial to the United States’ ability to innovate. There are good reasons why defense-tech giants of the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s like Raytheon and Grumman missed out on such major tech advances as Web protocols, the smartphone, personal computers and various types of encryption — all of which would eventually have great military significance. The biggest reason was that none of these advances were directed at waging war; indeed, many aimed at transcending the power of the state.After the Cold War, the Soviet Union’s extraordinary technological capacity dissipated in large part because it had been so reactive: The Soviets had let their adversary determine the pace and scope of their own innovation.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersWASHINGTON — IronNet Cybersecurity Inc, a startup led by former U.S. National Security Agency chief Keith Alexander, has raised $78 million in additional funding, the company told Reuters on Wednesday, a day ahead of a planned announcement.The Fulton, Maryland-based company plans to disclose the financing on Thursday as it releases the first details about deployment of new threat-sharing technology it has developed, which is dubbed IronDome, Alexander said. The series B round was led by London-based investor C5 Capital and joined by existing investors ForgePoint Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.IronNet declined to disclose the company's overall valuation following the financing, which is in addition to a $32.5 million series A round announced in September 2015. The company, whose 150 employees include former high-ranking officials from U.S. military and intelligence agencies, said it will use the funds to develop cyberdefense tools and support other growth initiatives.Five major U.S. energy suppliers deployed IronDome in November to help them share data on cyber threats in real time, Alexander said in an interview.The company intends to use the funding to set up similar IronDome systems for the healthcare and financial firms, Alexander said.""If our nation is under attack by another nation, we need to be able to share information in time to be able to prevent it,"" he said.IronNet developed IronDome to be faster and more automated than traditional methods used for sharing information about cyber threats, he said.IronNet declined to disclose the energy suppliers who are using IronDome, citing customer confidentiality. It said those companies collectively serve 25 U.S. states.The energy providers adopted IronDome amid growing concern among about the threat that hackers pose to the U.S. power grid and other critical infrastructure. The U.S. government has issued multiple warnings in recent years about attempts by Russia, North Korea and Iran to infiltrate those organizations. The Trump administration in March accused Kremlin-linked hackers of gaining remote access to energy sector networks, though it did not identify specific victims.Alexander ran the NSA from 2005 to 2014, making him the agency's longest-serving director. He was at the helm of the NSA in 2013 when former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden leaked data about classified U.S. surveillance programs that sparked an international debate about digital privacy.""You want to protect civil liberties and privacy and you want to protect critical infrastructure,"" Alexander said.

Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative charged with negotiating the deal, said last week that he aimed to wrap up talks in the next week or two. Ana SwansonMEDIADisney is expected to report strong results for its fiscal second quarter on Tuesday. ESPN is sound (for the moment). The theme park business is going up, up, up. And Walt Disney Studios, which released “Black Panther” in the quarter, is the envy of Hollywood. Analysts expect per-share profit to increase about 12 percent, and revenue to climb about 6 percent.But Disney’s near-term performance is not what Wall Street cares about most right now — not with Comcast positioning itself to upend Disney’s pending $52.4 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets. If Comcast does make a renewed push for Fox, is Disney willing to go to war? What happens if Fox slips out of Disney’s grip? Does Disney have a Plan B?Robert A.

Nick WingfieldECONOMYThe Bank of England, Britain’s central bank, faces a tricky balancing act when its rate-setting committee meets on Thursday. With inflation still sharply above the bank’s target, traders had been betting that policymakers would raise the benchmark interest rate.But a recent run of poor economic data — including disappointing growth figures and worse-than-anticipated results in the manufacturing sector — has prompted traders to revise those expectations. Mark J. Carney, the bank’s governor, has also played down the possibility of a rate increase. Prashant Rao Friday’s jobs report showed that the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent for the first time since 2000. That’s good news for workers, but it may add to fears that the tightening labor market will lead to faster inflation. Data that is to be released by the Labor Department on Thursday could add more fuel to the fire.Economists expect the report to show that consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in April and were up 2.5 percent from a year earlier, which would mark the fastest growth in more than a year. That acceleration would partly reflect higher oil prices, but inflation most likely picked up even setting aside volatile food and energy prices.The Federal Reserve has already factored somewhat faster inflation into its forecasts, but an unexpected spike could force the central bank to raise interest rates more quickly than planned.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBy James B. StewartWhen it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up?While regulators and a federal judge ponder that question, the great disrupter — Amazon — is already raising prices. Last week, it said its Amazon Prime service, which includes its extensive video offerings along with free shipping and other benefits, would cost $119, a 20 percent increase from the current $99.To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it’s only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon’s move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring.Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October.As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there’s no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner’s content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren’t direct competitors.While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense).But Amazon is already vertically integrated — it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).Which is why the so-called FANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) loomed large at the just-completed AT&T-Time Warner trial and may well figure in a Sprint-T-Mobile decision, even though none of the technology giants is directly involved or is a party to the litigation.AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. “The media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,” he testified. “It’s coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.”The Time Warner chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, made the same argument. “They have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,” he said, adding that by “they” he meant the FANGs. “And they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.”In closing arguments this week, AT&T and Time Warner’s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year.The government’s lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: “The fact that AT&T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn’t give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,” he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.)AT&T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as “the wolves at the door,” said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. “That’s the center of their theory.”Time Warner’s content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, “are just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,” he said.Of course, the argument can be made that AT&T doesn’t need to buy a company like Time Warner — it could create a media content company of its own. That’s what Amazon and Netflix did, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming.But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn’t really matter. “The major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,” Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. “In turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflix is — would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?”Whether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest — it could well influence Judge Richard Leon’s decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12.If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal.Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts.The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger — a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny.The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services — exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn’t harm consumers.The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn’t have the power to raise prices.That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future.Courts and antitrust regulators “don’t usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. “Our crystal balls aren’t that good. We don’t have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.”While Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, “this whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.”Perhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they’re actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition.Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration’s antitrust policies, “they may feel there’s no reason not to roll the dice now,” Mr. Hovenkamp said.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"

But as one of Japan's smaller automakers, it faces growing costs to stay competitive in an industry which is being disrupted by new technologies, including self-driving cars and electric vehicles.It is also investing in a new plant in the U.S. state of Alabama, a joint project with Toyota Motor Corp which will give Mazda a production foothold in the country. The company forecast higher capital expenditure as well as research and development costs in the current year.The automaker, which is highly exposed to currency swings due to its heavy reliance on exports from Japan, is assuming an average dollar rate of 107 yen this year, versus 111 yen last year. Its view on the euro was unchanged at 130 yen.Mazda forecast global vehicle sales to rise 2 percent this year to a record 1.66 million units.

BEIJING/HONG KONG —  Chinese smartphone and connected device maker Xiaomi is bringing its blockbuster initial public offering to Hong Kong, where it could raise about $10 billion in the largest listing globally in almost four years.The IPO plans, filed on Thursday, will be one of the first in Hong Kong under new rules designed to attract tech listings, a major win for the bourse as competition heats up between Hong Kong, New York and the Chinese mainland.The listing is expected to give Beijing-based, Cayman-domiciled Xiaomi a market value of between $80 billion and $100 billion, just eight years after it came onto the scene in China, people familiar with the plans told Reuters.The $10 billion fund-raising target, if achieved, will make it the biggest IPO since Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd raised a total of $25 billion through a New York listing in 2014.AdvertisementThe IPO could be launched as early as the end of June, according to the people close to the process who requested anonymity as the details were not yet public.AdvertisementTwo separate people said the company's valuation would likely be lowered to a bit above $70 billion. One said Xiaomi was looking to sell about 15 percent of its enlarged capital in the offering.Xiaomi declined to comment on the valuation.The prospectus gave investors the first detailed look at Xiaomi's financial health ahead of the IPO, showing resilience in a slowing global smartphone market thanks partly to a push into overseas markets like India.Revenue was 114.62 billion yuan ($18 billion) in 2017, up 67.5 percent against 2016, the company said. Operating profit was 12.22 billion yuan, up from 3.79 billion yuan year-on-year.Xiaomi made a net loss of 43.89 billion yuan versus a profit of 491.6 million yuan in 2016, though this was impacted by the fair value changes of convertible redeemable preference shares.THIN MARGINSXiaomi plans to spend most of the IPO proceeds on three areas: research and development, overseas expansion, and investments, according to its filing.Alongside smartphones, Xiaomi makes dozens of internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, including scooters, air purifiers and rice cookers.It has a hard core of followers in China known as ""mi fans"", but there are concerns in the market over whether it will be able to replicate this fan base overseas.AdvertisementThe company boasts large gross margins - 60 percent last year - from internet services, including gaming and advertising linked to its homegrown user interface, MIUI, which had 190 million monthly active users as of March 2018.Yet margins on its smartphones are razor-thin. Xiaomi posted a gross profit margin of just 8.8 percent for its smartphone business in 2017 compared to 60 percent for its internet services business.According to some analyst estimates, Apple's flagship iPhone X and iPhone 8 have gross margins of around 60 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.Canalys analyst Mo Jia said that while Xiaomi's finances looked ""positive"", the firm needed to bolster its internet services business to warrant a high valuation. The segment slipped as a proportion of overall revenues last year.""Xiaomi markets itself as an internet company, its valuation is closely linked to whether the market buys this concept,"" he said. ""Otherwise, as a smartphone brand, Xiaomi couldn't reach (such) a high valuation with what's on paper.""To be sure, its relatively cheap smartphones pose a rising challenge to market leaders Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc. Earlier this year it toppled Samsung as the top smartphone seller in India.Xiaomi doubled its shipments in 2017 to become the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker, according to Counterpoint Research, defying a global slowdown in smartphone sales.It is making a broader push outside China's borders, with 28 percent of its sales derived from overseas markets last year, up from 6.1 percent in 2015.DUAL-CLASS SHARESXiaomi's listing plans come as the company and its investors look to capitalize on a bull run for the Hong Kong market, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index rising about 27 percent over the past year.AdvertisementHong Kong is eyeing several tech listings in the coming two years, including those with dual-class share structure, from Chinese firms with a combined market cap of $500 billion.""For Hong Kong to have the opportunity to put away a deal of Xiaomi's size is a good way of showing other institutions out there that might be considering coming to Hong Kong that there is a clear pathway,"" said Keith Pogson, senior partner for financial services at EY.Xiaomi said it would have a weighted voting rights (WVR) structure, or dual-class shares. The WVR give greater power to founding shareholders even with minority shareholding.Lei and co-founder Lin Bin will be the beneficiaries, being the holders of the Class A shares. Each Class A share has 10 votes while each Class B share has one vote. Lei currently owns 31.4 percent of Xiaomi while Lin holds 13.3 percent.Xiaomi is also likely to be among the first Chinese tech firms seeking a secondary listing in China, using the planned depositary receipts route, two people with knowledge of the matter said.CLSA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley are joint IPO sponsors.($1 = 6.3610 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Cate Cadell in Beijing, Julie Zhu in Hong Kong and Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Fiona Lau and Alun John; Writing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Adam Jourdan; Editing Stephen Coates)We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp said on Sunday they had agreed to a $26 billion all-stock deal and believed they could win over skeptical regulators because the merger would create thousands of jobs and help the United States beat China to creating the next generation mobile network.The agreement capped four years of on-and-off talks between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, setting the stage for the creation of a company with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the top two wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.U.S. regulators, who have challenged in court AT&T's $85 billion deal to buy U.S. media company Time Warner Inc, are expected to grill Sprint and T-Mobile on how they will price their combined wireless offerings. Verizon has 116 million U.S. wireless customers, according to a spokesman, while AT&T has 93 million branded customers, as of the first quarter.Their first round of merger talks ended unsuccessfully in 2014 after the administration of then-U.S. President Barack Obama expressed antitrust concerns.The new deal will create the highest-capacity U.S. network, lower prices, create jobs and improve service in rural areas, said John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile and the new head of the proposed combined company.The combined company, which will be called T-Mobile, will invest $40 billion over the next three years to upgrade its networks to accommodate the next generation 5G wireless technology, which is expected to have the speeds necessary to power drones and self-driving cars, Legere said in a statement.The companies said during a conference call with analysts that the recent U.S. tax overhaul would have a positive impact, and the combined company would not be a significant taxpayer until 2025.T-Mobile and Sprint said they expected to complete their deal no later than the first half of 2019, an ambitious goal given the intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny it will be subjected to. T-Mobile will not be liable to pay Sprint a breakup fee should regulators block the deal, according to sources who asked not to be identified because that detail in their contract had not yet been made public.The companies said they expected U.S. regulators would see the benefits of the deal.“This isn’t a case of going from four to three wireless companies – there are now at least seven or eight big competitors in this converging market,"" Legere said, referring to cable companies as wireless competitors. Other companies also would be forced to accelerate their investments in the face of a combined T-Mobile-Sprint, the companies added.A spokeswoman for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai declined to comment on Sunday on the proposed merger. The FCC will decide whether to grant the deal regulatory approval if it is in the “public interest,” the spokeswoman added.CTIA, a trade organization that represents the U.S. wireless communications industry, ranks the United States behind China and South Korea in 5G readiness. The Chinese government launched a plan targeting 5G deployment by 2020, with three carriers committed to the timeline.Legere said the deal would likely lead to lower prices from AT&T and Verizon, as well as Comcast Corp.AT&T declined to comment. Comcast could not immediately be reached for comment.Verizon declined to comment on prices but said it remained committed to building a 5G network. DEAL BREAKTHROUGHThe breakthrough in the companies' negotiations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday, came after T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom AG and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, agreed on a structure that would allow Deutsche Telekom to continue to consolidate the combined company, which will have a market value of over $80 billion, on its books.Deutsche Telekom will own 42 percent of the combined company, and will control the board of the combined company, nominating nine of the 14 directors. Legere will also serve as a director. The implied equity valuation for Sprint is $6.62 per share based on T-Mobile's closing share price on Friday. Sprint shares closed on Friday at $6.50.The all-stock transaction is at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile US share.Tokyo-based SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom will sign a voting rights agreement that will give Deutsche Telekom access to voting rights for a total of 69 percent of T-Mobile shares.The second round of talks between Sprint and T-Mobile ended in November over valuation disagreements.Since then, Sprint's shares lost about a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion.T-Mobile's market capitalization is $54.7 billion, while Sprint is valued by the deal at $26 billion.INVESTING IN 5G TECHNOLOGYEven though Sprint's customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market-share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody’s Investors Service Inc.T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans.Both Sprint and T-Mobile are far behind Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their network to accommodate next generation 5G wireless technology. Even after their merger, the combined company's budget to invest in 5G will be smaller than that of Verizon or AT&T.Sprint and T-Mobile hope the deal will give them more firepower to participate in auction for spectrum to develop 5G. They plan to participate in a spectrum auction in late autumn and will request a waiver if the merger prevents the companies from participating.PJT Partners, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Evercore served as advisers for T-Mobile.

technology,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Raymond Zhong and Paul MozurSHENZHEN, China — In a grand hotel ballroom on Tuesday, Huawei executives laid out a soaring vision for the future. The Chinese electronics giant, already the world’s biggest supplier of the equipment that powers the wireless age, now wants to provide the digital backbone for artificial intelligence, the internet of things and other transformative technologies.But that future is increasingly looking as if it will not include the United States.Last week, the company laid off five American employees, including William B. Plummer, the executive who was the face of its Sisyphean efforts to win over Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Huawei has also been dialing back its political outreach in the United States, these people said — which could end a decade of mostly fruitless efforts to dispel Washington’s accusations that the company has ties to the Chinese government.Huawei’s tactics are changing as its business prospects in the United States have darkened considerably. On Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to proceed with a new rule that could effectively kill off what little business the company has in the United States. Although the proposed rule does not mention Huawei by name, it would block federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to American national security.Like other major tech companies, whether American or Chinese, Huawei (pronounced “HWA-way”) has been caught in the crossfire as the Trump administration ratchets up efforts to stop China’s high-tech ambitions. The two countries are waging a new kind of cold war, and with each increasingly suspicious of the other’s technology, winners are chosen based on national allegiances.Huawei’s latest moves suggest that it has accepted that its political battles in the United States are not ones it is likely to win.One recent example of reduced communication with Washington came after the discovery in January of security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world’s computers. A Senate committee wrote to Huawei’s founder to ask what the company knew about the vulnerabilities, and how it had been affected by them. Huawei decided not to respond.“Some things cannot change their course according to our wishes,” Eric Xu, Huawei’s deputy chairman, said at the company’s annual meeting with analysts on Tuesday. “With some things, when you let them go, you actually feel more at ease.”Huawei’s main Chinese rival, ZTE, also hit a roadblock in Washington this week. The Commerce Department said it would ban the much smaller company from buying American components after it made false statements to the government as part of an investigation into possible violations of American sanctions.Yet Huawei’s experience also illustrates how little Washington can do to curb Chinese influence in cutting-edge industries throughout the rest of the world.At Tuesday’s meeting with analysts, executives at the company, which says it is owned by its employees and not by the Chinese state, emphasized growth opportunities in Europe and Asia. They also described ambitions to further diversify Huawei’s business into helping organizations of all kinds — not merely wireless carriers, but factories, governments and the police — transform themselves through cloud computing and artificial intelligence.“For Huawei, the major challenge is not how we can serve operators better,” said David Wang, a company president. Instead, he said, “we have to work harder to cope with wider challenges in all industries.”Huawei’s troubles in the United States have been mounting since 2012, when a congressional report warned that its gear could be used to spy on Americans or to destabilize American telecom networks. The company spent $1.2 million on lobbying that year. Last year, it spent $60,000 on such efforts.Major American carriers such as Verizon and AT&T have since shunned Huawei. The Commerce and Treasury Departments have subpoenaed it over possible violations of American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. The company’s ambitions to become a major smartphone brand — it is already the world’s third largest, after Samsung and Apple — were curtailed when AT&T abandoned a deal this year to sell its handsets. And a bill is before Congress to stop government agencies and contractors from buying Huawei products.The company has said repeatedly that its products pose no security risk and that it complies with the law everywhere it operates. Still, the layoffs last week appear to be an acknowledgment by Huawei that it has failed to clear the political cloud around it.Mr. Plummer, Huawei’s vice president of external affairs, had been with the company for almost eight years. He was the most senior member of Huawei’s American policy team who was not a Chinese citizen.It is not clear whether he will be replaced. The company’s policy operations in the United States are led by a relatively recent arrival, Zhang Ruijun, who took the post nine months ago after working for the company in Mexico and Russia.A Huawei spokesman said in a statement that any layoffs simply reflected an effort to better align resources with “business strategy and objectives.”“Any changes to staffing size or structure are simply a reflection of standard business organization,” he said.Founded three decades ago, Huawei made $93 billion in revenue last year — not much less than Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and more than its two main rivals in telecom gear, Nokia of Finland and Ericsson of Sweden, combined.When it comes to the next generation of mobile internet, or 5G, Huawei has invested heavily in technology development.Chinese carriers are likely to deploy such networks more quickly than their American counterparts are, at least in the beginning. But as 5G comes up in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe, Nokia and Ericsson will catch up, said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst in New York with New Street Research.Still, Huawei’s telecom business could be dampened as other countries, particularly allies of the United States, weigh risks to their national security. The chief executive of a leading wireless provider in South Korea told the newspaper The Korea Herald last month that the company was unsure whether to use Huawei’s 5G equipment.In the United States, Huawei customers that would be affected by the F.C.C.’s proposed rule — small carriers in rural areas — may soon need to find new equipment suppliers.These carriers love Huawei gear, said Carri Bennet, general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association, an industry group for American telecom companies with fewer than 100,000 subscribers.“They just love it,” she said. “It works like a charm, the customer service support is awesome,” and the price is attractive, she added.The association’s members have even elected a Huawei executive, William Levy, to their board.Ms. Bennet said that rather than blacklisting specific manufacturers, Washington should be creating a system for testing telecom gear for security vulnerabilities.“These companies who are reliant on this support, they don’t have the funds to overhaul their whole network,” she said. “Public safety, getting 911 services, broadband — it all just starts falling apart.”Follow Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur on Twitter: @zhonggg and @paulmozur.Raymond Zhong reported from Shenzhen, China, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS"
